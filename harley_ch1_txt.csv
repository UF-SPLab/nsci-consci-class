"1 The Problem of Consciousness
       This chapter will introduce you to consciousness and its most important characteristics.
We will look at definitions of consciousness, and examine what it means that being conscious
is a private experience. We will look at the question of what is it like to be us, or to be someone
or something else. The chapter introduces you to ideas and themes that will be covered in more
detail in the rest of the book, and explain why the topic is an important one.
      Research on consciousness is big on questions and rather shorter on answers.
Nevertheless these questions get at the heart of what it means to be human, or indeed at the
heart of what it’s like to be anything - what it’s like to be conscious.
      Think of yourself just now. What does it feel like you to be you right at this moment?
Think of a loved one. What do you think it is like to be them? Do they know exactly what
they’re feeling, and do you know just what they’re feeling? We might have some idea, but the
                               ft
answer in both cases is no, and not only “no”, we can’t see how we ever could know for sure.
It’s my consciousness and your consciousness.

WHY STUDY CONSCIOUSNESS?
 ra    The study of consciousness is the study of what means to be us. We perceive the world
(or at least we think we do) through the lens of our consciousness. And how can we understand
the universe if we don’t understand how we experience it?
     What is consciousness and how does it arise are two of the fundamental questions of
science, along with others such as “what is life?” and “where did the universe come from?”.
     The study of consciousness is at the limit of our understanding of natural science. For
some researchers the gap between our understanding of consciousness and the laws of physics
is so large that they think physics must either be incomplete, or the understanding
consciousness is beyond physics.
Consciousness and psychology
      Consciousness is related to many other important topics in psychology that have
important consequences for how we think about ourselves. The study of consciousness is a
unifying topic in psychology because consciousness links research on attention, working
memory, perception, decision making, and language. We think of consciousness as the result
                                                   37

"of all the processing that goes on in the mind. For example, when perceptual processing of an
object is complete, it enters visual awareness.
Consciousness and neuroscience
      The search for the seat of consciousness in the brain has shown how parts of the brain are
connected, and how information flow between them gives rise to consciousness. Neuroscience
research on consciousness has advanced our understand of how psychological processes are
underpinned by brain systems, and how normal psychological processing depends on the
delicate balance of many systems in the brain. It shows what can go wrong and how. Some of
the most exciting neuroscience research is currently being carried out on topics related to
consciousness.
Consciousness and philosophy   ft
      Consciousness is entwined with one of the fundamental concerns of philosophical
D
thought, the problem of free will. It seems to me that as I sit here, aware and conscious writing
this paragraph in a trendy coffee shop, that I am choosing to not pick up my mug of coffee and
throw it on the floor. This choice is my free will in action. On the other hand, if all I am is
 ra
determined by my genes and my past, and by the history of the universe up to now, that sense
of free will is illusory, and it has already been determined that I will remain seated here, sipping
my coffee, polite, restrained, and demure. I have no choice.
       The study of consciousness tells us who we are - or are not. Who is this “I” that has a
choice, or not? When “you” are deciding to do something, who is the “you”? Who is in control?
We often think of ourselves as watching the world and observing our mental life, as though
there is a person with us. We call this little person a homunculus (see Box 1.1), but the
homunculus idea suffers from the problem of an infinite regress. A related idea is that we have
permanent “selfs” that experience things. I think of myself (myself is my self) as being the
same person as I remember listening to a piece of music on my fifth birthday. Why do I think
that? Does it make any sense to do so? I think of my self as having an identity that persists over
time. Where does this notion of “self ” come from? As we shall see, many consciousness
researchers would go as far as to say that the self is an illusion. Research on consciousness will
cast light on where our sense of ourselves and of our identities comes from.
      The study of consciousness has implications for society. If we don’t have free will, there
are important consequences for how we view individual responsibility. If I had no alternative
other than to rob the bank, why should I be punished for the crime?
                                                   38

"Box 1.1. The homunculus inside us
      Homunculus means “little person” in Latin. It is as if there is a little person inside our
heads who observes everything and decides how to act. The idea has its roots in alchemy. Some
version of the homunculus idea is popular among non-psychologists (and some psychologists
too), and even turns up in popular culture: we don’t really think there is a little person inside
us, but we do have the impression that “I” an looking out from inside my head at the world.
The problem with the homunculus idea is that there is no idea how the homunculus works.
Does the homunculus have another homunculus inside it, observing and controlling and the
bigger homunculus? If so we have only displaced the problem, and quickly enter an infinite
regress of homunculi inside each other.

Consciousness and spirituality
                              ft
      Consciousness is the bridge between science and the humanities. Why do you find a
particular piece of music moving, or a piece of art beautiful? Can you imagine a computer
D
appreciating beauty or justice, and why not? Science does not tell us how to behave, while
ethics in philosophy describes ways of living, and does suggest how we should behave. But
what would such injunctions mean without consciousness?
 ra   Our consciousness is intimately involved with our spirituality, our deepest values and our
sense of things beyond science. What do we find spiritual, and what creates these feelings of
spirituality? You may meditate, or attend church, or practise a religion in some other way, and
feel that some experiences are richer or on a higher plane than everyday experience. Or you
might have experienced some unusual state, such as feeling that your mind has left your body.
Some people have taken drugs to “expand” their consciousness; what, if anything, does this
mean? What is the relationship between these different states of consciousness?
      The study of consciousness also informs what happens when we are not conscious,
including when we are asleep, when we are in a coma, and when we are dead. Is sleep merely
the absence of consciousness? What happens when we are dying, and afterwards.
     The study of consciousness informs our search for meaning in life. However, being
conscious can be sometimes seen as a curse. Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813 -
1855) put it very nicely in 1844:
     “What does it mean to be a self-conscious animal? The idea is ludicrous, if it is not
monstrous... It means to know that one is food for worms. This is the terror: to have emerged
from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner
yearning for life and self-expression—and with all this yet to die.” (Kierkegaard, 1980).
                                                  39

"Without consciousness there would be no pain, but neither would there be pleasure, joy,
beauty, or love. And it’s one of the most fascinating topics in science, and a topic that bridges
science and the arts. Those are pretty good reasons to study it.
HOW WE STUDY CONSCIOUSNESS
      The scientific study of consciousness was once the sole domain of philosophers, but is
now an interdisciplinary affair. I’m not sure whether the word “consciousness” was used at all
in my undergraduate degree in psychology at Cambridge back in prehistory. Fortunately that
has changed, and consciousness is being studied by a coalition of psychologists, philosophers,
neuroscientists, surgeons, computer scientists, and anthropologists. We call the research
carried out by this joint enterprise of cognitive scientists ‘consciousness studies.’
      One way of finding out about consciousness is just to think about what you’re
                              ft
experiencing. After all, you’re conscious right now, so why not just consider what’s going
inside your mind? This process of observing ourselves and reporting on our experience is called
introspection. Introspection has its uses, but it’s not that reliable. By definition we can only
introspect upon what we’re conscious of at the time. Our knowledge of ourselves is limited and
D
we are often not aware of our limitations. These limitations are shown by the work of
psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman (2012) on human reasoning. For example, when we
make judgments about things such as spending money, we think we’re making a reasoned
judgment, but in fact we’re influenced by all sorts of biases and prejudices of which we are
 ra
mostly unaware. For example, we’re usually strongly averse to taking risks. We might not
actually be conscious of very much at any one time, but everything else of which we are not
conscious might nevertheless be influencing us. So when we introspect and report on the
contents of our consciousness, and think about why we’re behaving in a certain way, our picture
is at best incomplete, and occasionally quite wrong. We’ll look in detail at the limits of
introspection, and how difficult it is to know our own mind, in much more detail in Chapter 6.
      Therefore, to properly study consciousness we instead usually carry out psychological
experiments that measure some variable we think is associated with consciousness, and observe
the effect of our experimental manipulations on that variable. We then make an inference from
our results to construct a theoretical model of what is happening.
Scientific experimentation
     Psychology and neuroscience are experimental sciences (see Box 1.2 and Box 1.3).
Typically we manipulate or measure independent variables (such as the length of a word) and
                                                  40
",40,1
"observe the effect of these manipulations on a dependent variable (such as how long it takes to
name that word). Consciousness research is difficult because there is no way yet known of
measuring consciousness and so of turning it into a dependent variable. There is no
“consciousnessoscope” that we can put on our heads and read out a number for how conscious
we are, what we’re really thinking, or what we’re experiencing just now. This difficult
sometimes motivates pessimism about how far we can get with studying consciousness. But
even if we cannot (yet) measure consciousness directly, we can measure variables that we
assume are dependent on or related to consciousness, such as a verbal report of something, or
a judgement about ourselves or the world.
      Psychology and the study of consciousness has advanced rapidly with modern
developments in techniques of brain imaging. Until not too long ago the only way of looking
at a brain was to wait until a person died and then carry out an autopsy. Imaging enables us to
look at the living brain, and modern functional imaging enables us to look at what the living
brain is doing. Other techniques enable us to influence what the brain is doing, So for the first
time we can see what is happening as the brain as we think and make decisions.
                               ft
      There are though a few caveats we should bear in mind. The first is that the techniques
are still restricted in what can be done: it takes a relatively long time to take measurements (at
the moment), so the temporal resolution of brain imaging is presently not that accurate. Other
techniques that are more accurate in identifying when things are happening currently have
D
relatively poor spatial location, so there is a trade-off between temporal and spatial accuracy;
And the machines are still big and noisy, so it’s going to be difficult (but not impossible) to
test people when they’re sleeping and dreaming, say. Of course all these limitations will
 ra
probably disappear, hopefully sooner rather than later. The second caveat is more important:
we are not measuring consciousness directly, but what is going on in the brain, and as the only
access to consciousness is through a person’s verbal report, or some other indirect measure of
what is happening, the best we can do is correlate our imaging data with aspects of
consciousness. Nevertheless, the techniques are a huge advance in what has previously been
available, and are in part responsible for the scientific study of consciousness being taken more
seriously than it has previously been.
      Another way of studying the relationship between the brain and consciousness is to
examine the effects of brain damage upon consciousness. The effects of damage to the brain
vary depending on exactly which parts of the brain are damaged (by injury, stroke, or surgery)
and how much. We shall see that the study of brain damage reveals a great deal about the nature
of consciousness. These neuropsychological studies are now often combined with imaging so
that we know exactly which parts of the brain are damaged.
Box 1.2. The role of falsification in science
                                                  41
",41,1
"Science is a method of gaining knowledge about the world. We use the scientific method
when we collect data about the world and construct theories to explain those data. Data is
anything we can measure. These theories then lead to novel predictions, which we can then test
against more data. If the predictions are verified, then the theory is supported and gains in
strength; if the predictions are wrong, then the theory has to be revised in some way. The
eminent Austrian-British philosopher of science Sir Karl Popper (1902 - 1994) argued that the
business of science was falsification: instead of trying to prove our theories, we should be
trying to disprove them. It’s only by finding that our predictions are wrong that science
progresses and theories are overturned. We rejected Aristotelian physics because its
predictions, such as that the velocity with which different objects travelled when dropped from
the same height depended on the objects’ weights, and what happened to bodies in motion if
no other forces acted upon them, turned out to be wrong once experiments were carried out.
Newtonian mechanics gave a much better account of the world.
        Although falsification is important, science doesn’t always progress by rejecting falsified
theories. There are two main reasons for this pattern. First, if a theory has done very well,
                               ft
people are understandably reluctant to reject it altogether and go back to the scratch and design
a whole new theory just because one prediction is falsified. Perhaps the whole theory isn’t
wrong, but just one of the assumptions we have made along the way? So when we drop a
feather and a heavy ball from the top of a tower, and observe the feather floating down as the
D
ball plummets, we don’t reject Newtonian mechanics. Instead we think about factors such as
air resistance, and realise that it’s our assumption that the medium through which the objects
are falling doesn’t matter is wrong, not the whole theory. Second, we have to make
measurements to collect data. Perhaps our measurements or our observing devices are wrong.
 ra
If I look at a section of a brain through a microscope, and see a perfectly circular black object
in it, it’s most unlikely that I’m observing a new brain structure that has amazingly been missed
for centuries - and far more likely there’s a mark on my microscope lens.

Box 1.3 The history of neuroscience
      Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, with cognitive neuroscience
as the study of how the nervous system and associated biological processes underlies cognition.
      For a long time the most common means of studying how the brain is related to human
behaviour was an autopsy performed on a person with brain damage; we observe the effects of
damage while the person was living, and then later find out which parts of the brain had been
damaged. In some cases researchers could estimate which parts of the brain were affected by
examining the location of the injury (such as the position of the blasting rod that perforated the
brain of the railway worker Phineas Gage in 1848). In others operations neurosurgery told us
exactly which parts of the brain had been damaged; for example, in split-brain patients we
                                                   42
",42,1
"knew that the only damage was to the body of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum that
connects the two cerebral hemispheres. We could also extrapolate from animal studies,
although naturally some caution is necessary in linking animal studies to human models,
particularly given animals do not use language, and the degree of self-awareness is limited and
questionable.
      More recently non-invasive techniques of brain imaging have enabled scientists to
examine the structure of the brain and measure its electrical activity while working. The biggest
revolution has come from a technique known as functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), which
allows us to observe what different parts of the brain are doing in real time, with reasonable
spatial and temporal accuracy. The earliest scientific studies on humans were carried out in the
early 1990s, but as the equipment has become cheaper and more accurate, and the skills
necessary to carry out the research more widespread, the use of fMRI is widespread.
      As with any technique the use of imaging require some caution. First, the brain is always
doing more than carrying out the specific task under consideration, so methods are necessary
                                ft
to isolate the task of interest from the background noise. Second, we need to remember that
knowing where and when something is happening might not tell us exactly what is happening.
Nevertheless there is no doubt that psychology is a very different subject from thirty years ago,
and our understanding of behaviour and the relationship between the brain and behaviour
enormously advanced.

Philosophical thought experiments
      Philosophy is the study of fundamental problems concerning the nature of knowledge,
what exists, the nature of the mind, and the nature of values. In this book our primary concern
is the sub-discipline known as the philosophy of mind. One of the most important weapons in
the armoury of the philosophy of mind is the thought experiment, in which we consider some
hypothesis or situation, and think through the consequences to what we think is a logical
conclusion. Science is characterised by experiment, but thought experiments deal with
scenarios that are impossible, or at least very difficult, to construct in reality, at least now. The
idea is that the thought experiment reveals our prejudices, or shows how our prejudices lead us
to surprising conclusions. A good thought experiment clarifies the problem and our
assumptions. We will meet many in the next few chapters, including the China Brain and Mary
the clever neuroscientist.

"Artificial Intelligence
      Another way of investigating consciousness is to try and build it. Is it possible that a
computer or robot could be conscious? Or is consciousness for some reason restricted to
biological systems? Supposing we could build one, what would be the characteristics of a
conscious machine - would we able to say exactly what it was that we did to make the computer
conscious, or would artificial consciousness be as baffling as human consciousness? And
crucially, how would we tell if the computer was consciousness or not? In the Terminator series
of films, the artificial Intelligence (AI) SkyNet launches a nuclear attack on humans in an
attempt to defend its self awareness: if we do construct a sentient artificial intelligence, would
we have anything to fear from it? Could we limit its powers so that it poses no threat?
      As well as constructing an artificial intelligence, we could construct machines that move
and interact physically with the world, machines better known as robots. Robots can be made
to look more like humans, but appearances can be deceptive. How important is being able to
                               ft
interact with the world for the development of consciousness?
     Although well beyond our current capability, we could aim to learn about psychology,
neuroscience, and consciousness by trying to build a brain. Attempts at doing so are already
well underway, and to date we attained large-scale models containing millions of neurons.
D
There are two ways of faint about the problem: simulating neurons, or building artificial
neurons, with the first slower but currently easier. In a similar vein we could augment, or
“upgrade” our brains with specialised components, ranging from very simple capabilities
 ra
(fancy a GPS chip?) to much more wide-ranging (such as more memory). What are the
implications for consciousness of such changes?
DEFINING CONSCIOUSNESS
     The British psychologist Stuart Sutherland once famously defined consciousness as:
      “… a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it
does, or why it has evolved.” (Sutherland, 1989).
       Sutherland goes on to say that nothing worth reading has been written about it. I hope
that if nothing else this book shows that this statement is no longer true. It is true however that
consciousness is difficult to define. It’s one of those things that you know when you see it.

                                                   44
",44,1
"You probably think you know what consciousness is, so how would you define it? Then
use a search engine to find some definitions of consciousness. How do they compare with your
own?
Definitions of consciousness
     Consciousness is our experience of being us here now. It’s what is lost when we are in a
dreamless sleep and what returns next morning when we wake up (Tononi, 2004; Tononi &
Edelman, 1998). I was going to add that consciousness is permanently lost “when we die”, but
as we shall see in Chapter 17, that statement also leaves plenty of room for discussion.
      Vimal (2009) reviewed the various meanings of the word consciousness used in the
research literature, and in his survey he identified forty distinct meanings. Vimal concludes
that “consciousness can be optimally defined as a mental aspect of an entity (system or process)
                               ft
that has dual-aspect: conscious experience and conscious function. In other words, a system or
a process is conscious iff [an abbreviation of ‘if and only if ’] its mental aspect is conscious
experience and conscious function” (p. 17). Note that we have the word “conscious” in the
definition of consciousness!
D
Awareness
 ra  The words “aware” and “awareness” crop up consistently in dictionary definitions of
consciousness: being conscious involves being aware. When we ask people what they think
consciousness is we might get told that it’s what it’s like to be awake, and it’s what it’s like to
be aware of things. “Awareness” then is clearly important in our conception of consciousness.
And of course, look up the meaning of “awareness” and you get … “conscious”.
       In addition to being aware, we can be self-aware, in that we can be aware of our being
aware. While we think we are aware all the time we am awake, we are only self-aware when
we turn our attention to our awareness. And while you may think many animals are aware, is
it likely that few if any of them are self-aware? Perhaps self-awareness is what sets humans
apart from other animals? That’s an important question and one we’ll discuss in Chapter 4.
      Notice that we can only be conscious of our own experience. We cannot explain to
another person what it is like to be us, and they can’t explain to us what it is like to be them.
They can’t describe the pain they feel in a way that we can feel it. There is something essentially
private about consciousness.
                                                   45
",45,1
"We can only be aware of our consciousness now. Of course our consciousness isn’t
completely trapped in the present because we have our memories, but when we remember
something, it is the memory we’re aware of, not the original event.
Try this
      Whatever you are doing, just observe your mind. What is happening? What are you aware
of now? Were you thinking about something in particular? Were you thinking in words, or in
pictures? Were you remembering something, or perceiving something? Now can you make
yourself aware of something else? Try and hold on to the present moment for as long as
possible; how soon is it before you would say things have changed and you’re in a new
moment? How would you characterise self-awareness, awareness of your awareness?
The problem of other minds
                               ft
      There’s something peculiar about our own experience. Consciousness is very different to
the world outside our heads, which is typically studied by science. There are several ways of
D
describing this difference: we can say that consciousness is subjective, and everything else
objective. We have the first-person perspective in our own mental life, whereas science uses
the third-person perspective to describe the world. The outside world is public, but our
 ra
experience is private.
      This privacy of consciousness makes its study so difficult. What is it like to be you? Other
minds are for ever closed to us. Our experiences are private, and we have no way of sharing
them. The problem of other minds is that we have no way of knowing what anyone else is
experiencing - I cannot access the contents of your consciousness, or you mine. We cannot
truly share our pain. We can use words like “pain” and “red” and “hot” and hope that you mean
the same things with them as I do.
       In 1962 the American philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote a famous paper called “What is
it like to be a bat?”. Bats navigate and find prey by sonar - a totally different kind of sense to
the five human senses (see Figure 1.1). We can guess what it is like to be most other humans
because we assume that we all have broadly similar types of experience, but we cannot begin
to imagine what it must be like being a bat. A bat perceives the world primarily through a sense
we do not possess, echolocation, a form of sonar. The bat emits a sound, mostly in a frequency
range beyond the limits of human hearing, and detects the echo. The sense is accurate enough
to be able to enable the bats to hunt fast-moving insect prey. Presumably it is like something
to be a bat, but we cannot conceive of it. According to Nagel, we can never really grasp what
it is like to be a bat; some aspects of “bathood” are, as McGinn (1989) puts it, perceptually
                                                  46
",46,1
"closed to us. There’s nothing special about bats - it’s just that the differences between us and
them are rather extreme more than between us and other mammals.
      We are even limited in what we can conceive about human experience; I cannot begin to
imagine what it must be like to be blind from birth, and surely neither can a person who has
never seen contemplate what sight must be like. Helen Keller was born in Alabama in 1880; at
around 19 months old she contracted an illness, possibly scarlet fever or meningitis, that left
her deaf and blind. When she was 7 years old she started to learn to communicate through touch
with her teacher, Anne Sullivan (see Figure 1.2). What would the experience of Helen Keller
been like before that moment of contact? Even after that in what ways would her experience
be similar and dissimilar to ours? Keller’s story is remarkable: she lived until the age of 88,
and was the first deaf-blind person to obtain a degree in art.

D
THE HARD AND EASY PROBLEMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
 ra   The Australian philosopher David Chalmers called the central problem of consciousness,
that of how the objective processes studied by science, particularly the physical structure of the
nervous system and brain, give rise to subjective experience, as the hard problem. The hard
problem is sometimes phrased in terms of the explanatory gap, which is the difference in our
ability to explain physical properties of the universe with physical laws and our inability to
explain mental properties. The hard problem is the problem we have in bridging this gap
between mechanistic laws and feelings and experiences.
      In contrast to the hard problem, the easy problems are everything else we want to know
about consciousness. They’re questions about psychological processes such as what’s the
difference between being awake and asleep and being in a coma, how vision and the other
senses work, how we plan for the future and control our behaviour, what are the processes that
control how we sleep and dream, what is attention, how we access memories, how we access
and report our internal states, how drugs affect us, how we decide to act and move, how brain
damage alters cognitive processing, what we can report about our own mental processes, and
many more. Note that these problems are only easy relative to the hard problem: in spite of a
hundred years or more of experimental psychology, our understanding of many of them is
patchy at best.
                                                  47

"For philosophers such as Dennett (2014), once we have solved all the easy problems
(which he thinks aren’t that easy at all), the solutions to the “hard problem” will drop out - or
the hard problem will turn out not to be a problem at all. We just don’t understand the field or
the problems properly yet. A similar line is taken by Dehaene (2014), who argues that the
“easy” problems are in fact the hard ones, and our labelling of “easy” and “hard” changes as
our knowledge of the field evolves. A different line is taken by the philosopher Peter Hankins,
who also says that the easy problems are hard ones, but that the hard problem is in fact
impossible to solve (Hankins, 2015).
       If this book were about the hard problem alone it could be a very short book. We have
made enormous progress over recent years on the easy problems, but very little on the hard
problem, other perhaps than understanding it better. As we shall see, some people argue that
we can never, in principle, solve the hard problem. Others think we have as good as solved it,
or at least know the way to solve it, while others deny even that there is a hard problem. Others
just hope we will make progress one day.

INTENTIONALITY: ARE WE ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF
SOMETHING?
D     “Conscious” is an ambiguous word - in everyday conversation we can use it in different
ways. There’s consciousness in the sense of awareness that we’ve just been looking at. You
 ra
can be ‘conscious of the time” - meaning that you are aware of the time and that the clock is
ticking. We might also say something like “I’m conscious that you need money”. In this sense
of consciousness, we’re conscious of something.
      This point is an important one: consciousness when used this way is about or directed
towards something. In fact consciousness always seems to be directed towards something. We
are always aware of something. We are conscious of our thoughts, or sensations coming in
from the outside world, or of our body, and perhaps all of these at once. It seems impossible to
be completely empty headed. Even if you try to think of nothing, that nothing becomes the
something that consciousness is directed towards. The idea that consciousness is about
something is called intentionality. Although the idea is an old one, one of the earliest
philosophers to discuss intentionality at length was the German philosopher Franz Brentano
(1838 - 1917). Brentano was one of Sigmund Freud’s PhD supervisors, and his ideas influenced
early psychoanalysis. Brentano (1874) said that intentionality is one of the major characteristics
of thought and consciousness: they are always about something.
      There are limits on what we can be conscious of. You can’t be conscious of your
digestion. Occasionally you might hear an embarrassing rumble, or be aware of indigestion,
but these are side effects of digestion acting on the nervous system. But the processes of
digestion themselves are completely opaque to us. Getting closer to home, when we
                                                  48
",48,1
"accidentally stab ourselves with the rose thorn, we are conscious of the pain, but not of the
nerve cells that carry that pain, no matter how hard we might try.
      Consciousness is also unable to access many psychological processes. When you hear
someone say a sentence, you understand it (normally); but you can’t make yourself aware of
how you understood it. When you’re a skilled driver, or tennis player the processes involved
are automatic. Indeed focussing on skilled performance can cause problems: if a skilled tennis
player or golf player starts to focus consciously on their movements, performance can
deteriorate quite dramatically.
Try this
      Try be conscious of nothing at all. Empty your mind. Do you think it is possible to be
conscious without being conscious of anything? If you think it is, how do you know you’re not
thinking of anything?
TYPES OF CONSCIOUSNESS
                               ft
D     Psychologists and neuroscientists are justifiably proud of the progress they have made in
understanding the brain and behaviour and the relationship between them over the last century
or so, with the rate of progress accelerating over the last few decades. Many say that they’ve
 ra
made huge progress in understanding consciousness as well. But this chapter has examined
some of the fundamental problems of consciousness thrown up by researchers, and it should
come as no surprise that several people have distinguished between different types or aspects
of consciousness.
Phenomenal and access consciousness
      The American philosopher Ned Block (1995) distinguished between phenomenal
consciousness and access consciousness. Phenomenal consciousness is what we experience:
it’s what it’s like to be us. It’s the sensations of perception from the outside, and the experience
of wanting, thinking, and feeling from the inside. It’s what we’ve been talking about mostly in
this chapter, and for many understanding phenomenal consciousness is the central “hard
problem” to be addressed. Access consciousness is concerns language, thought, controlling
action, and reasoning. Access consciousness concerns what we talk and think about, and
importantly, it’s what we can report - so it’s our thoughts, feelings, and desires themselves
(rather than our experience of them) and the representations that are manipulated in cognition.
                                                   49
",49,1
"Block uses the abbreviations P-consciousness and A-consciousness. Most cognitive
psychology experiments are on A-consciousness, while the Try This thought experiments in
this chapter have mostly been about P-consciousness. A-consciousness is definable within a
computer programme, but P-consciousness is not.
      To what extent are P and A consciousness dissociable - that is, can we have one without
the other? Normally, Block says, P-consciousness and A-consciousness interact, but in
principle they could exist independently of each other. So Block believes that beings could
exist that would have A-consciousness but not P-consciousness: for example, we might build
a robot that does all the things we do but without phenomenal consciousness. On the other hand
many non-human animals may have P-consciousness but not A-consciousness; they have
experiences but the experiences are not involved in cognitive processing, so they have
experiences but not sense of them selves experiencing. What this statement means in practice,
and how we could tell for sure, are difficult to evaluate.
      Block’s division is controversial because P-consciousness is by definition non-
                              ft
computational - only A-consciousness can be manipulated symbolically. That is, it takes A-
consciousness to solve a math problem or write a sentence. Block (1995) made much use of
introspection: only events that are available to introspection, our ability to look into our own
minds, can be manipulated symbolically. Furthermore, if we accept this type of distinction, we
must also accept that sensations arise from non-computational mechanisms, an idea some
D
researchers find unpalatable (see the Block, 1995, target article for many peer critiques of his
ideas).
 ra
     Another problem with this distinction is that many people feel P-consciousness is all we
normally mean by consciousness; what Block calls access consciousness, while important for
psychology, isn’t really anything to do with consciousness.
Other types of consciousness
      Other researchers make similar types of distinction as Block’s between phenomenal and
access consciousness. The Nobel Prize winning American biologist Gerald Edelman
distinguished between primary consciousness, which is the awareness of the present arising
from the binding together of information from different senses and the integration of the senses
with recent memory, from secondary consciousness, which is awareness of our consciousness
and the ability to access our thoughts, plans, and memory. Secondary consciousness enables
us to manipulate our own thoughts and carry out abstract reasoning (Edelman, 2003).
      What all these attempts at categorisation show is that we are aware that we need to make
certain distinctions - between awareness and non-awareness, between awareness and
awareness that we are aware, between feeling and emotion, and between living merely in the
                                                 50
",50,1
"present, having a memory for the past, and a sense of the future. The lack of agreement in these
divisions shows that we do not know how best to carve up the space of consciousness and
awareness.
      Many people are interested only in core consciousness and P-consciousness, and wonder
why we need to be concerned with those peripheral psychological and neuroscience issues such
as attention, memory, and vision. For these people (like Chalmers) we should tackle the hard
problem head on, in as much as we can, because that’s the only important question in
consciousness research. On the other hand, for those like Dennett who believe that the hard
problem will only be solved by attacking the easier ones, these “peripheral” problems are the
key to everything else.
Degrees of consciousness
                              ft
       Consider whether you are conscious when you’re dreaming. We can have vivid visual,
auditory, and sometimes motor experiences. So, we’re conscious, but in a way that’s clearly
different from “normal” waking consciousness. We are though (usually) unable to reflect upon
these experiences; they may be very bizarre, but they don’t cause us to stop and think “hey,
D
this is weird, this shouldn’t be happening; am I dreaming?”. Our ability to influence our actions
in our dreams is very limited. What about when we’re asleep and not dreaming? Mostly we’re
say we’re unconscious, but even the being unconscious isn’t the same as not existing: if there’s
a loud noise in the room when you’re sleeping, you’ll most probably wake up.
 ra  What about a baby laughing away at some dangling toy? Infants don’t yet have language;
they don’t yet have many memories; they can’t move very far; their consciousness must be
very different from ours, yet most people would say that they’re conscious in some way.
      What about a chimpanzee, or your companion animal, or a bird in your yard? They all
seem to act as though they’re conscious in some way. Most people think that other primates
are conscious. Many animals can clearly seem to show distress and signs of being in pain. If
shown a series of photographs - a human, a picture of an early human, a chimpanzee, a dog, a
bird, a fish, a shrimp, a bacterium - and asked which you think is conscious, what wold you
say? Answers can vary a great deal, but mostly draw the line of consciousness somewhere
between a bird and a fish. We have no way of knowing (at the moment) what the answer is,
but clearly most people think that consciousness is not limited just to humans. And as we shall
see, people might be being tough on the fish (see Chapter 5).
      Clearly the consciousness of babies and dogs is different from adult human
consciousness, but does it make any sense to talk about degrees of consciousness? Am I more
conscious than a dog or a baby? The noted polymath Douglas Hofstadter (2007) clearly thinks
so; in his book I am a Strange Loop he presents a hierarchy of consciousness , in which he
                                                  51
",51,1
"talks about “more” and “less” consciousness. Are we more conscious when we’re wide awake
than when we’re dreaming? Hofstadter’s proposed hierarchy of consciousness is illustrated by
Figure 1.3. Note that there’s guesswork involved: maybe some birds are more conscious than
some dogs. Who knows? If we talk about “more conscious”, then we are presuming that
consciousness has some kind of size dimension that can be measured, and it is most unclear
what this dimension should be.
      Research on anaesthesia and people in comas and with different types of brain damage
also suggests that it makes sense to talk about consciousness as a graded phenomenon (see
chapter 10 for more on this). And what about when you’re waking up, particularly if you’re
confused as to when it is and where you are? We say “we’re not quite awake yet”, and that
could be taken more literally than we might have intended.
      Humans are not just aware of their surroundings, but are also self-aware in that we can
be aware of our own awareness - we can reflect on our consciousness. This ability is mostly
restricted to normal waking consciousness, because dreaming is usually characterised by a lack
                               ft
of self-awareness and an inability to stop and ask if we’re awake or asleep This apparently
infinite regress of being aware of being aware of being aware is an example of what is called
recursion - when something is defined or uses itself. Some researchers think that the ability to
think recursively is limited to humans and is essential for the ability to learn human language
(Corballis, 2014). If this idea is correct then it will be the case that only humans are capable of
D
self-awareness.
 ra
      Our consciousness can be changed from its normal waking state in various ways.
Dreaming is an obvious example, but the most dramatic changes occur after taking mind-
altering drugs. The effects of such drugs can be mild, depending on the drug and dose, or
extremely dramatic, as with hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. How do drugs alter the mind,
and how do their chemical effects lead to changes in perception, cognition, and particularly our
consciousness? How is the biology of drugs related to our phenomenology?
     There are though many other ways in which consciousness can be altered. Meditation,
mindfulness, and hypnosis are all techniques deliberately employed to change our normal
waking state. What changes are involved, and how does the brain change in parallel? Profound
mystical or religious experience also involve a change in consciousness. Sensory deprivation
can be used both as a means to relax and as a method of torture.
      Death is the final alteration of consciousness. Is that right - is death like a switch, which
when pressed just leads to the permanent extinction of consciousness? How do we define death,
and is it a sudden or gradual process? Some people who are close to death but then survive
report near death experiences, typically involving feeling peaceful, even joyful, and often
travelling down a tunnel of light. What accounts for such unusual experiences? Are these
people really going to heaven and coming back, as some of them think?
                                                   52

"It’s clear that our “normal” waking state of consciousness is not the only type of
consciousness. What accounts for the phenomenology of these states - what we feel and
experience - and how are the changes in state related to changes in the nervous system?

THE PROBLEMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
      From the preceding discussion it seems that the problem of consciousness is really several
related problems. The following summary of eleven problems for consciousness researchers
amplifies and extends our discussion above, introducing some key terms and ideas. The
                              ft
remainder of the book shows our current state of knowledge about each of them.
     1. The “hard problem”. Why does it feel like something to be me? Why do sensations
  appear to us as they are? Why do we have phenomenal experiences at all? When most people
  think about consciousness, they have the hard problem in mind.
D    2. The “temporal problem”. Why do I have the illusion of choosing to act when my brain
  has made that decision for me some time ago? The brain activity associated with
  consciousness appear too late for consciousness to be involved in perceptual processing and
 ra
  motor action.
      3. The “free will problem”. How and why do I have the illusion of choice and control if
  all my actions are determined?
     4. The “why? problem”: We are only certain that humans are self-aware and conscious,
  although it is likely that some other animals are conscious to some degree. It is however
  likely that many animals get by perfectly well without self-awareness. So why this additional
  complexity? Why are animals conscious but not beaches of sand or galaxies of stars even
  though they contain huge numbers of grains of sand and stars? Why is my laptop not
  conscious (I think)? Why is a horse more conscious than a fly (probably)?
     5. The “self problem”. Who is this “I” who thinks they have a choice? Who is
  experiencing my experiences?
     6. The “unconscious problem”. Why are some things conscious, and others unconscious?
  What additional things does consciousness give us? Virtually all processing is unconscious,
  so why do a very few things become conscious - particularly if it is too late to affect
  anything?
                                                 53
",53,1
"7. The “cognitive problem”. Does something as complicated as an intact adult human
  have to be conscious? What is it about our cognitive machinery that gives rise to
  consciousness? Where does consciousness fit into cognitive processing?
     8. The “binding problem”. How do different sensations get bound together so that we
  perceive one thing with all the associated emotions? Why when I see a tiger do I see the
  orange and black stripes moving with each other and see the shape of the tiger distinct from
  the background? Why when I hear the tiger’s roar does it seem to come from the tiger? And
  why does that object alone in the environment promote feelings of fear and awe? Binding is
  both within modality (so that we recognise one object with everything in the right place) and
  across modalities (the roar goes with the sight of the tiger).
     9. The “neural correlates problem”. How does the brain give rise to consciousness? Are
  there particular brain structures we can identify that are active when we engage in certain
  sorts of processing? How does brain damage affect consciousness? Why does the cerebral
  cortex appear to give rise to consciousness, but not the cerebellum, even though it contains
                              ft
  more neurons and is just as richly interconnected?
      10. The “altered state” problem: What do we mean by a “normal” state of
  consciousness? What causes an alteration in our state of consciousness? How do changes in
  neurotransmitters in the brain lead to changes in the phenomenology of consciousness? What
D is altered in an altered state of consciousness?
  complete account of consciousness?

    11. The “science problem”: Is it even going to be possible for science to provide a
      In this chapter we’ve examined what consciousness is, and hopefully you now also have
some idea of why consciousness is more mysterious than it might first seem. There are many
questions in this chapter, and if you’re expecting definitive answers to all of them by the end
of the book, you might be disappointed.

"CHAPTER SUMMARY
     • Consciousness concerns our awareness and self-awareness.
     • We study consciousness because it is the study of what it means to be us, and pushes
 the limits of our understanding of science.
     • Consciousness is a unifying topic in psychology and philosophy.
     • Consciousness is linked to the question of whether we possess free will.
     • Consciousness involves the study of spirituality and higher states of consciousness.
    • Consciousness can be altered through the use of drugs and psychological techniques
 such as meditation.
                            ft
    • We can study consciousness by introspection, observing our own thoughts, but this
 method is limited and unreliable.
     • We can study conscious by carrying out experimental studies where we study the
 effects of manipulations on variables we think are associated with consciousness.
D   • We can study philosophical considerations in consciousness with thought
 experiments.
 ra • We can attempt to construct robots and computer models of consciousness, and
 analyse the features necessary for a machine to perhaps acquire consciousness.
     • There are many definitions of consciousness, but awareness and self-awareness are
 central concepts. It is difficult to provide a definition that does not involve some degree of
 circularity.
     • Consciousness is private - no one else knows what we are thinking just now, and
 indeed we cannot describe to another person exactly what we are thinking.
     • The “hard problem”, as posed by Chalmers, can be phrased in several different ways,
 but all reduce to trying to explain how subjective experience arises from the physical
 structure of the brain
    • We cannot really imagine what it is like to be another person or another type of animal.
     • Consciousness is always about something.
    • Different people appear to have different things in mind when they talk about
 consciousness, and sometimes even the same person uses the word differently at different
 times.

"• Researchers have distinguished several types of consciousness, but they all reflect a
distinction between core consciousness and psychological mechanisms that appear to rely
on or make use of consciousness in some way, such as attention, memory, and perceptual
processing.
   • Core consciousness is the self-awareness that a person experiences in the moment,
    • Block distinguished between phenomenal consciousness, which concerns sensation
and phenomenal experience, from access consciousness, which concerns self-report and the
ability to manipulate ideas.
    • Our state of consciousness changes when we sleep, or if we take certain types of “mind
altering drugs”, as well as in other ways.
    • The degree of consciousness differs between organisms.
    • We can identify eleven specific problems concerning consciousness: the hard
problem, the temporal problem, the free will problem, the why problem, the self problem,

the cognitive problem, the binding problem, the unconscious problem, the neural correlates
