# Somatosensory Potentials: Libet 

> "Studies suggest that consciousness of an event is only associated with electric field (or electric potential) patterns in neural tissue that persist for at least 300 to 500 ms"

- Backward Masking
   - An experimental procedure in which target images are flash very briefly and conscious awareness is blocked by subsequent images.
   - Suppose two stimuli are presented to a subject. The second stimulus is presented less than 500 ms after the first. The second stimulus may "mask" conscious awareness of the first stimulus.
