## fMRI & EEG                



## Functional MRI{.smaller}

- Noninvasive & precise location
- **Hemodynamic Response** blood vessel response to metabolic demands of brain activity 

- Glial cells 
    - sense surge in synaptic activity 
    - chemically signal local arteries to dilate
    - To compensate for increased energy consumption
    - blood flow increases few seconds later
    - bringing in more oxygen and glucose
                                             
- Human brain activity at millimeter resolution
- Half-second resolution (at best)
- Cannot track time course of neuronal firing for consciousness (< 0.5 sec)



## Electroencephalography (EEG)

- Noninvasive & precise time 
- Electrical currents at synapses                                 
- Recording of brain waves invented in the 1930s,
- High-powered technique, with up to 256 electrodes   
- Brain activity with millisecond resolution over the whole head
         

                                    
## fMRI, EEG, & cognitive psychology

- sequence of brain activation (EEG) 
- from retina to frontal cortex (fMRI)
- combined with cognitive psychology offers window into conscious mind
                                             
             
> The presence of these patterns of neural activity, like a signature on a document, would reliably index conscious perception.

- On conscious trials only, 
    - an ample voltage wave sweeps through this region. 
    - starts around 270 ms 
    - peaks anywhere between 350 - 500 ms 

- **P3/P300 wave**: slow and massive event 
- P3 wave (because it is the third large positive peak after a stimulus appears) 
- P300 wave (because it often starts around 300 milliseconds).
- many observed paradigms

# Consciousness Lags Behind the World 



## Thinking "Slow"{.smaller}

> We are all blind to the limits of our attention and do not realize that our subjective perception lags behind the objective events in the outside world.
                                             
- conscious perception is heavily filtered
- time lag of at least 1/3 sec (Nunez *Chapter 2.7, Consciousness Takes Time*)
- Brain conpensates for delays (like back-dating a check)
                                             
> Any pianist who rushes through an allegro knows better than to attempt to control each of his flying fingers—conscious control is way too slow to tramp into this fast dance.
                                             



## Anticipatory Autopilot{.smaller}

::: columns 
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Anticipation is a second mechanism that compensates for the sluggishness of our consciousness
    - sensory & motor areas contain temporal learning mechanisms 
    - anticipate events of outside world

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

An unfortunate consequence is that, when an unanticipated event occurs—for instance, a brief flash of light—we misperceive its onset.

Relative to a dot moving at predictable speed, a flash of light appears to lag behind its true position.
                                             
Only when our brain’s anticipation mechanisms fail do we become acutely aware of the long delay that our consciousness imposes

## Error Monitoring{.smaller}

- Error perception actually operates in two steps, (much like the perception of any other physical attribute): 
1. unconscious appraisal 
2. conscious ignition.
                                             
- **Error-Related Positivity** (or **Pe** for short), 
- virtually indistinguishable from the familiar P3 wave that accompanies our conscious perception of sensory events.

# Igniting the Conscious Brain



## Global Ignition{.smaller}

- Analogy: audience with a few claps -> bursting into applause. (Hebb, 1949)
- Network of neurons excite one another fall into a global pattern of synchronized activity. 
- Dehaene’s research suggests ignition occurs when broadcast excitation exceeds threshold and becomes self-reinforcing. 

- Water freezing to ice is the phase change from liquid to solid.
- Concept of phase transition captures many properties of consciousness
- Like freezing, consciousness has threshold

> Does a conscious message trigger a brain-scale phase transition, freezing brain areas together into a coherent state?

- To test, experiment varied one single physical parameter of a display, like slowly dropping temperature of water vial
- Examined whether subjective reports, and objective marker of brain activity, behaved discontinuously with sudden burst like a drastic phase transition. 




## Global Ignition{.smaller}
                                            
> Whenever we become aware of an unexpected piece of information, the brain suddenly seems to burst into a large-scale activity pattern. My colleagues and I have called this property “global ignition.” Dehaene  & Naccache, 2001
                                             
- **Global ignition**
    - excitation exceeds a threshold
    - becomes self-reinforcing (positive feedback-loop)
    - some neurons excite others that return the excitation. 
    - (Dehaene Sergent Changeux, 2003)



## Global Ignition{.smaller}

- strongly interconnected neurons 
- burst into a self-sustained state of high-level activity, 
- reverberating “cell assembly,” (Hebb)

# Deep Inside the Conscious Brain



## Intracranial E-phys: Humans{.smaller}

- Unlike exterior recording using fMRI, new experiments with epilepsy patients place electrodes directly inside brain
- Used experiment to track step-by-step progression of word into cortex along visual pathway
- Early results very similar: after 300ms, huge change in activity. 
- 70% of interior recording sites showed significant influence of consciously perceived words
- Only 25% for unconsciously perceived words
- Conclusion: unconscious information in narrow brain circuit, consciously perc. Info. Is globally distributed.

## Seen Vs Unseen trials{.smaller}

- After 300 milliseconds
    - the difference became massive
- Unseen trials 
    - Activity died out 
    - No frontal activation
- Seen trials
    - Massively amplified activity
    - All-or-none ignition
   


## Brain Oscillations {.smaller}

- Brain emits variety of electrical fluctuations of various frequencies
- Stimulus perturbs current waves by reducing or shifting them
- When subject was given a word, saw enhanced gamma activity within first 200ms. 
- Gamma died out for unseen words, remained sustained for seen words. 

Electrophysiologists distinguish many different rhythms in the EEG signal. The awake brain emits a variety of electrical fluctuations that are coarsely defined by their frequency bands, conventionally labeled with Greek letters. The bestiary of brain oscillations includes the alpha band (8 to 13 hertz), the beta band (13 to 30 hertz), and the gamma band (30 hertz and higher).

## Resonance and Synchrony 

![:image 80%](nwt/Pik_Ros_fig_4.jpg)





## Windows of Opportunity{.smaller}

In essence, synchrony opens up a channel of communication between distant neurons.                
If they shout in unison, however, their voice is much more likely to be heard and relayed.                 
Neurons that oscillate together share windows of opportunity during which they are all ready to receive signals from one another. The synchrony that we researchers observe in our macroscopic recordings may indicate that, at the microscopic scale, thousands of neurons are exchanging information.
                            
What may be particularly significant for conscious experience are instances when such exchanges occur not only between two local regions but across many distant regions of the cortex, thus forming a coherent brain-scale assembly.

# 4th Signature of Consciousness 
<h1 style="color:#E28F41;">The Brain Web</h1>
:::


- Synchrony facilitates transmission of information.
- Massive synchronization of electromagnetic signals across cortex 
- Late time window (+300ms) 
- “Brain web” exchange of long distance signals.
- Distant electrodes synchronize
   - but only if the image is consciously perceived 




## Rhythm Nesting{.smaller}
 
Conscious perception, by contrast, involves long-distance communication and a massive exchange of reciprocal signals that has been termed a “brain web.”

::: columns 
::: {.column width="50%"}                      

- The frequency at which this brain web is established varies across studies, but it typically occurs in the lower frequencies of the beta band (13–30 hertz) or the theta band (3–8 hertz)

- Presumably these slow carrier frequencies are the most convenient for bridging over the significant delays that are involved in transmitting information across distances of several centimeters.
                            
- frequencies tend to be “nested” inside one another: high-frequency bursts fall at predictable moments relative to lower-frequency fluctuations. 

- We need new mathematical instruments in order to understand these complicated patterns.

## Statistical "Causality"{.smaller}
                           
Back in 1969 the British economist Clive Granger invented this method to determine when two time series—for instance, two economic indicators—are related in such a manner that one may be said to “cause” the other.

- Leading Indicators
                            
- Given two temporal signals, the method asks whether one signal precedes the other and predicts its future values.
                            
- signal A is said to “cause” signal B if the past states of A predict the present state of signal B better than the past states of signal B alone does.
                            
- nothing, in this definition, precludes a causal relation in both directions: A may influence B at the same time as B influences A.






## Statistical "Causality"?{.smaller}

> The brain is so tightly interconnected that causality is an essential but challenging issue to determine. 

- Does activation progress in a bottom-up fashion, from sensory receptors to higher-order integrative centers in the cortex? 

- Or is there also a significant top-down component, in which the higher regions send descending prediction signals that shape what we consciously perceive? 

- Anatomically, bottom-up and top-down pathways are both present throughout the cortex. 

- Most long-distance connections are bidirectional, and the descending top-down projections often vastly outnumber the ascending ones.



## Causal Explosion{.smaller}
                          
Specifically during the consciously perceived trials, we observed a massive increase in bidirectional causality throughout the brain.
                            
Once again this “causal explosion” emerged all of a sudden around 300 milliseconds.                 
The forward-moving wave is consistent with an obvious intuition: sensory information must climb up the hierarchy of cortical areas, from primary visual cortex to increasingly abstract representations of the stimulus.
                            
The most encompassing description is that the brain falls into a “distributed attractor”—a large-scale pattern of ignited brain regions that, for a short while, produces a sustained state of reverberating activity.



## Sub... Liminal{.smaller}

on unconscious trials; the brain web never ignited. There was only a transient period of causal interrelations in the ventral visual cortex, but it did not last much beyond 300
                            
Quite interestingly, this period was dominated by descending top-down causal signals. It looked as if the anterior regions were desperately interrogating sensory areas. Their failure to respond with a consistent signal resulted in the absence of conscious perception.


# The Tipping Point & Its Precursors



## The Tipping Point & The Avalanche{.smaller}

- Avalanche metaphor: After the ignition threshold is reached, which takes about (300 ms), top down signals are sent from the frontal regions to various distributed areas in addition to the bottom-up sensory signals being sent from lower regions. 



## Before The Avalanche{.smaller}

- Some experiments detect correlate of conscious perception before the stimulus is presented
    - could be random variation among trials based on unexplainable differences in neural activity
- Unpredictable neural fluctuations 
    - Support or fight against avalanche
- Preconditions: Random neural fluctuations 
    - produce pre-existing biases to support or discourage consciousness
- We must distinguish between the correlates of consciousness and the signatures of consciousness
