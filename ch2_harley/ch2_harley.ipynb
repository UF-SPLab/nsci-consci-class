At the same time, another lightning bolt hits a different part of the swamp and spontaneously rearranges a huge load of molecules so that, by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form as your body at the time of your little accident. Let’s not worry too much about the physics and biology; this after all is a thought experiment. This being has been called “Swampman”. As Swampman, looking just like you, wanders around the world, he will behave exactly like you. He will carry reading the same book, and say hi to all your friends just as you would. Is Swampman (or Swampwoman) really just you? What is your intuition about this argument? What does it tell us about consciousness?\n",
