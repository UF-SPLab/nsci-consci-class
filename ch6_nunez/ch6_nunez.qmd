- **Resonance**
    - The tendency of a system to respond mainly to a narrow range of input frequencies.
- **Fundamental frequency**
    - Lowest natural frequency of a system.
- **Harmonic frequencies** (harmonies or partials):
    - Integer multiples of some fundamental frequency; a special case of overtones. Called "partials" by musicians.

- **Overtone**
    - Natural frequency higher than the fundamental frequency; may or may not be harmonic. Violin strings have harmonic overtones; the violin body has non-harmonic overtones.

- **Frequency band**:
    - Small range of frequencies. Alpha frequency band is defined as 8 to 13 Hz. Visible light occupies a very narrow frequency band of electromagnetic radiation.
- **Phase**:
     - Location of a sine wave along the time axis. Or, the time difference between the two peaks of two sine waves.
- **Coherence**:
    - The consistency of the phase-difference between any two signals, with each signal normally composed of multiple frequencies. *Expressed as a (squared) correlation coefficient for each frequency component with magnitude always between zero and one.* Coherent signals may or may not be synchronous (**zero phase difference**).

Coherence does **NOT equal** Synchrony

- delta
- theta
- Alpha
- local and global alpha rhythms, typically recorded in relaxed subjects n closed eyes. 
- Different alpha rhythms with similar or equal frequencies selectively modulated by different mental tasks. 
- In the lower (beta rhythm) , the subject might also have been engaged in some difficult mental task. 
- gamma rhythms (40 Hz range) on the scalp are very low-amplitude and dif- It or perhaps impossible to distinguish from muscle artifact. 

- REM sleep is shown, but it somewhat resembles the beta trace. 
- Stage 2 sleep consists of 'tures of relatively fast (theta and alpha) and very slow (delta) frequencies,  
- Stage 3 (deep sleep) is dominated by delta frequencies near 1 Hz, as wn in the uppermost plot. 
- A normal sequence of the sleep stages as they ur overnight was shown earlier in figure 4-3, indicating that the REM stage ciated with dreaming is sometimes viewed as a partial awaking. The brain cally cycles through four or five sleeping cycles each night.

:::{.notes}

a | Long-range coherence among the prefrontal, parietal and visual cortex during a spatial attention task in humans. Neuronal activity in the frontal eye field (FEF), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and area MT was reconstructed from the magnetoencephalogram (left panel) of subjects performing a demanding visual motion-discrimination task during which stimuli were shown in the left and right visual hemifield. During a delay interval following the cue to shift attention ('Delay', middle panels), long-range phase coherence in the gamma-band (35–100 Hz) between the PPC, area MT and FEF was enhanced in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended visual hemifield compared with the non-attended hemifield (top). At the same time, low-frequency alpha-band coherence (5–15 Hz) between area MT and PPC was suppressed in the attended hemifield compared with the non-attended hemifield (bottom). Similarly, during stimulus presentation ('Stimulus', right panels), attention enhanced long-range coherence in the gamma-band between the PPC and area MT in the contralateral hemifield (top) and suppressed coherence in lower frequency ranges among the PPC, FEF and area MT in the contralateral hemifield (bottom). b | Directed gamma-band (40–60 Hz) interactions between the prefrontal and visual cortex during spatial attention. Local field potentials (LFPs) were simultaneously recorded from the FEF and visual area V4 (left panel) of macaque monkeys attending to one of several visual targets. Following the cue indicating which target to attend, feedback interactions in the gamma-band (quantified by Granger causality) were enhanced between those neuronal populations in the FEF and V4 that encoded the attended target (middle panel). Approximately 50 ms later, feedforward interactions in the gamma-band were also selectively enhanced between these neuronal populations (right panel). c | Frontoparietal beta-band (13–18 Hz) coherence during the attentional blink in humans. Neuronal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and PPC was reconstructed from the magnetoencephalogram (left panel) of subjects detecting target letters in a rapid serial visual stream. The rapid and successive presentation of target letters causes subjects to miss a substantial fraction of the targets. Correct target detection was associated with enhanced long-range beta-band coherence (quantified by the phase-locking value) between DLPFC and PPC (middle and right panel). d | Long-range beta-band coherence (15–23 Hz) between the frontoparietal (FEF and PPC) and visual cortex (area MT) (left panel) during processing of an ambiguous visual motion stimulus. Neuronal activity was reconstructed from the electroencephalogram of human subjects presented with two moving bars that could be perceived either as bouncing or passing (see stimulus schematic at the top of the right panel). Long-range coherence was enhanced in a widespread cortical network including bilateral FEF, PPC and MT (middle panel). Coherence within this network was enhanced for approximately 1 second around the time of bar overlap in the beta-band from approximately 15 to 23 Hz (right panel). Beta-band coherence in this network predicted whether the subjects perceived the bars as bouncing or passing.

black: 5.5 Hz & 11 Hz

- indicate frequency bands where rhythm amplitudes (averaged over all scalp sites) always increased during the five transitions between resting and calculation states, 
- and always decreased during the four transitions between calculation and resting states. 
- In other words, mental calculations were consistently associated with increases in higher-alpha-band (mostly 10 to 12 Hz) and theta-band (mostly 5 to 6 Hz) amplitudes.

Gray: 8-10 Hz

- The gray region (8 to 10 Hz) indicates just the opposite result— lower alpha- band amplitudes consistently decreased during mental calculations. Only these small parts of the displayed spectrum (1 to 20 Hz) yielded changes that were consistent across all nine state transitions; no repeatable changes in the delta or beta bands were observed. 
- Of course, if we were to relax the consistency requirement, moderate statistically significant effects in the delta and beta bands would be found as well. 
- The amplitude reductions in the lower alpha band tended to be larger than the amplitude increases in the upper alpha band. 
- Thus, if we were to lump the entire alpha band (8 to 13 Hz) into a single category, we would find that "alpha" is reduced or "blocked" by mental activity, as many earlier studies have reported. 
- Thus, the common phrase "alpha blocking" is, at best, misleading. These results remind us again of the intricate, detailed nature of dynamic patterns associated with different kinds of mental activity; the simple Christmas-lights analogue fails miserably in this case.
