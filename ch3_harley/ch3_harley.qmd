# What is Determinism?

## Determinism

"Determinism" is the idea that the next state of something is determined purely by its current state and history, and current state is also predictive of future states. This is a principle that, in theory, could apply to all physical systems, including the universe as a whole.

# Determinism and/or free will?

## Determinism and/or free will?

- Human behavior
- Dualism and free will
- Why does mind being a different substance help with the problem?

## Determinism and free will

- Determinism is the idea that everything in the world is determined by physical forces
    - Paul Nunez has a much better probabilistic definition: 
      - *a range of positions in which future events are fully or mostly determined by current conditions.*
- Free-will is the idea that we have a choice


# Problems with Free-Will

## Is free will an illusion?:

- We appear to ourselves to have free will, but perhaps it is just an illusion


## Quantum mechanics

- Quantum mechanics & probabilistic determination don’t help
   - We still don’t have any choice
   - Having apparent "choice" determined by a chance event is still being determined by something else

## The homunculus in the Cartesian theatre

- An homunculus is a small being sitting in another one watching what is going on and deciding to act
- The homunculus is in a Cartesian theatre where all sensory information is displayed

| Consciousness                 | Believed to have conscious control over actions; however, research suggests this might be an illusion. | Not aware it is under external control; acts as if it has free will.                         |
| Control Mechanism             | Brain events cause consciousness; free will is debated.                                     | Electrodes implanted in motor cortex and medial forebrain bundles control actions.          |

| Free Will                     | Controversial; some believe in free will, while others think it's an illusion.               | Appears to act on "free will," but it's actually controlled by external signals.             |
| Purpose of Actions            | Actions often driven by complex motivations, goals, and beliefs.                            | Actions are conditioned responses to specific signals sent to the brain.                     |
| Ethical Considerations        | Ethical considerations often guide behavior.                                                | No ethical considerations; acts based on conditioning and external control.                  |

## The benefits of believing in free will

- If it is an illusion, what are the advantages of believing that we have free will?
- It enables us to tell a story about our lives - Wegner
- It affects how we behave (maybe?)

| Benefits from Believing in  Free Will                          | Potential harm of Believing in Free Will                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Helps maintain a narrative of events in our lives.      | Can lead to attributing control where there is none.    |
| Gives a sense of responsibility and morality.           | May encourage superstitious beliefs and magical thinking.|
| Helps maintain social cohesion and group dynamics.      |                                                         |
| Encourages proactive behavior and action.               |                                                         |
| Research suggests it leads to more moral behavior, less cheating, and more willingness to help others. | Research on these effects is not universally accepted and may be short-lived. |
|                                                         | Raises questions about the role of consciousness if everything is decided unconsciously. |


:::{.notes}

The text suggests that the belief in free will serves various psychological and social functions, such as providing a narrative for our lives and encouraging moral behavior. However, this belief can also lead to misconceptions, like attributing control to events where we have no influence, and can complicate our understanding of consciousness.

:::{.notes}


- **Compatibilism**: Philosophers like Thomas Hobbes argue that individuals are the source of any decision, and thus morally responsible. Daniel Dennett suggests considering the whole system, not just the "illusory 'I'" that we think is making a decision.
  
- **Incompatibilism**: This position can lead to libertarianism, which maintains free will by rejecting determinism. Versions of libertarianism vary, with some accepting dualism and others, like those proposed by Robert Kane and Robert Nozick, not requiring a rejection of materialism.

- **General Observations**: Peter Strawson suggests that the problems of free will and determinism may be more about language than actual philosophical issues. Regardless of the philosophical stance, the text suggests that people will continue to think in terms of moral responsibility and right and wrong.

| Free Will   | Individuals have the ability to choose between different courses of action, making them morally responsible for their choices. | If free will is an illusion, as some argue, then holding individuals fully responsible for their actions becomes problematic. |
| Determinism | If actions are determined by prior events and conditions, then society can hold individuals responsible as a form of social contract, even if they couldn't have acted otherwise. | If all actions are predetermined by prior events, then the concept of moral responsibility is undermined. Individuals may not be fully responsible for their actions if they are simply "mediating history." |




## Punishment, Rehabilitation, Treatment? {.smaller}

**Mental Illness**

- Should individuals with ASPD  be treated the same as those with schizophrenia?  
   - both are classified as disorders. 
   
- The law often considers people with ASPD to have a level of insight into their actions.
- Individuals with conditions like schizophrenia are often considered to have diminished responsibility, aligning more with the deterministic viewpoint that these individuals are not fully in control of their actions.

  
  
**Neurological Factors** 

Studies have shown that the brains of people with ASPD function differently, particularly in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. This raises questions about their level of responsibility.


-  The text mentions that the brains of people with ASPD are systematically different, which could be used to argue both for and against responsibility depending on one's viewpoint on free will and determinism.


**Social/Environmental Factors**

- Early social conditions like early development malnutrition and social neglect can increase likelihood of later criminal behavior, raising questions about moral responsibility.

- The deterministic viewpoint might argue that these individuals are less responsible for their actions due to these external factors. 

- A free-will perspective might still hold them accountable.


- **Neuroethics and Neurocriminology** 

- These fields study the implications of neuroscience for understanding morality, ethics, and criminal behavior. 
- Explore questions like whether it is ethical to treat someone with ASPD against their will.
- These fields explore the ethical implications of neuroscience findings on questions of free will, determinism, and moral responsibility.


**Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)**  

- Should individuals with ASPD should be held responsible for their actions?

- Western law tends to hold individuals responsible, suggesting a free-will perspective that they could have acted otherwise.




## Deciding to act

![](Bereitschaftspotenzial_fig1.jpg)


[Neuroscience of Free Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will)

:::{.notes}

On several different levels, from neurotransmitters through neuron firing rates to overall activity, the brain seems to "ramp up" before movements. This image depicts the readiness potential (RP), a ramping-up activity measured using EEG. The onset of the RP begins before the onset of a conscious intention or urge to act. Some have argued that this indicates the brain unconsciously commits to a decision before consciousness awareness. Others have argued that this activity is due to random fluctuations in brain activity, which drive arbitrary, purposeless movements

## Libet's experiments on "voluntary" movement

- Criticisms of Libet's experiment
   - Experience of "will" is subtle or vague 
   - A clock is not precise
   - Large signal when person doesn't even move
   - More in brain involved than SMA
   - Simplistic


## Measuring brain activity with EEG

- We can measure action and apparent decision making with brain imaging techniques

## Involuntary action

- Skill and habit
  - driving
  - brain surgery
- Psychological compulsions
  - tics, anxious behaviors, etc.

## Alien hand syndrome

- When the hand is not under the control of the mind

## Skill and habit

- As we become more practised at a skill actions change from voluntary to automatic

## Compulsions

- We sometimes feel compelled to do things against our will

- OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder)

## Summary

- Free will is the sense that we are in control of our destinies and can choose between alternatives
- But in a deterministic universe, how can this feeling be anything other than an illusion?
