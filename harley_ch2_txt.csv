"2 The Mind-Body Problem
      The mind-body problem is the philosophical problem of how the mind is related to the
the brain. How can subjective experience (consciousness) arise from a brain (a physical part of
the body)? How does three pounds of pulsating pink goo give rise to our sensations, our
feelings, our thoughts, and all our other mental activity? The philosophical consideration of the
mind-body problem has a long and sophisticated history. The general area of philosophy
concerned with the mind-body problem is called the philosophy of mind (see Box 2.1).
      This chapter considers two questions. First, what can we say about the nature of the
relationship between consciousness and the brain - between mind and matter? We will look at
the fundamental ideas of dualism and monism - how many types of “stuff ” are there? Is mind
different from physical matter? And second, what is the nature of subjective experience? In
terms of the problems of consciousness defined in Chapter 1, this chapter are mostly about
                              ft
problem number one: the hard problem. There are several other problems to solve, and perhaps
their solution might illuminate the topics covered in this chapter.
      We beginning by introducing the philosophical tool known as a thought experiment.
We then consider what for many is the most intuitive explanation of the main relation between
D
mind and brain, that they are different kinds of stuff, and then discuss how most contemporary
researchers prefer the alternative, that there is only one kind of stuff: matter. We then have to
explain how sensations and private experience can be explained in a world comprised only of
 ra
matter. We consider the Knowledge Argument, which is often cited as a key argument against
physicalism. We consider the implications of another thought experiment, the inverted
spectrum. We consider another problem for a purely material view of the world, the subjective
experience of pain. We then examine another famous thought experiment, that of the
philosophical zombie, a hypothetical being that looks like us and acts like but has no conscious
experience.
     We then consider some formal models relating brain to mind, of which currently the most
popular is functionalism. We then throw our hands up in despair when considering
mysterianism, the possibility that we’re just not biologically or cognitively equipped to
understand our own consciousness. We conclude by examining different types of
consciousness.
      It is worth noting that a textbook on physics or chemistry summarises knowledge and
shows the way to carrying out further research. Such books are built on certainty. This chapter
provides no certainties, just disagreement and argument. You might conclude that if, after
centuries of thought, the leading philosophers who have spent their lives thinking about the
subject can’t agree on the basics, what hope is there? But do not despair; that is what makes
the topic so fascinating.

"Box 2.1. Philosophy: Terms and disciplines
      Philosophy is the study of ideas: it is the study of knowledge and where it comes from,
of what exists and how we know that, of what is a good way to live, of what distinguishes good
from evil, of what makes some things appear beautiful to us, and of logic, which is how we can
deduce new knowledge from old. Like all disciplines it has several sub-disciplines, particularly
for our purposes:
      Epistemology is the study of knowledge. It asks, Where does knowledge come from? Do
we acquire knowledge just from experience, or is some knowledge innate? What can we know
for certain? Sceptics doubt that we can be certain of very much.
     Ontology is concerned with the study of the nature of being and existence. What exists?
     Metaphysics is an umbrella term combining epistemology and ontology for the study of
fundamental questions about the basic cause and nature of things. “Metaphysical” is sometimes
used as a dismissive insult, but it shouldn’t be - the questions of metaphysics are among the
                              ft
most fundamental humans can ask.
      The philosophy of mind is about the issues raised in this chapter, and more besides: what
is the mind, and how do we gain knowledge about ourselves and the world?
D     The philosophy of science is a particular branch of philosophy concerned with what
scientists should do, and why. What is the nature of the scientific enterprise? What are its
methods, its goals, and its foundations?
 ra  The ancient Greeks made no distinction between philosophy and natural science. It was
only during the scientific revolution (starting with the astronomical work of Copernicus,
Kepler, and Galileo in the early sixteenth century) that a distinction started to emerge between
philosophy, religion, and science. Cambridge University didn’t even start teaching a degree in
natural science, including physics and chemistry, until 1851, although philosophy (and
mathematics) were well established centuries before then.

THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS
      We have noted that philosophers often conduct a particular kind of experiment: the
thought experiment, where we ask “what if” and carry out the experiment in our imagination.
These experiments are not designed to provide definitive or proven answers. Rather, merely
trying to answer these questions reveals our intuitions about the subject matter. It’s important
when we participate in a thought experiment to stop and think for a while about what our
answer would be.
                                                 60

"Thought experiments aren’t confined to the philosophy of mind: the famous
“Schrödinger’s cat” idea is a thought experiment in physics in which under one interpretation
of quantum mechanics a cat might be simultaneously dead or alive. The American philosopher
Daniel Dennett (2014) uses a version of thought experiment he calls an intuition pump in much
of his writing; intuition pumps are simple thought experiments that focus our minds on the
important aspects of a features, and simplify our thinking by avoiding largely irrelevant detail.
They may be structured to mislead our reasoning in a revealing way, and give a series of
answers on the path to what he considers to be the correct answer. Their point is to illustrate or
clarify our argument, not to reveal an answer, for as we shall see many times, our intuitions are
often wrong.
Try this
                               ft
      One of the most famous thought experiments discussed by Dennett was first first
formulated by the philosopher David Donaldson (Donaldson, 1987). You go hiking in a swap
(don’t ask why) and get struck and killed by lightning. At the same time, another lightning bolt
hits a different part of the swamp and spontaneously rearranges a huge load of molecules so
that, by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form as your body at the time of your little
D
accident. Let’s not worry too much about the physics and biology; this after all is a thought
experiment. This being has been called “Swampman”. As Swampman, looking just like you,
wanders around the world, he will behave exactly like you. He will carry reading the same
 ra
book, and say hi to all your friends just as you would. Is Swampman (or Swampwoman) really
just you? What is your intuition about this argument? What does it tell us about consciousness?
THE MIND AND THE BRAIN
      We all know what our mind is … don’t we? “Mind” though, like consciousness, is one
of those words that we use all the time and that we think we know what it is, but can be difficult
to define. The mind is everything about our mental life, both inside and outside of
consciousness: the cognitive processes giving us perception, thinking, and memory.
     The central issue is how the mind and the brain are related: how does the brain, a thing,
permit us to have private mental experiences? Experiences are not things, so how do they arise
from a thing? Or more precisely, things, because the brain has a complex structure and is made
up out of 100 billion neurons. This question is the central one of this chapter.
     It is easy to fall into the trap of talking about the brain as though it’s the same thing as
the mind. It isn’t, and making the mistake of doing so its called the mereological fallacy.
                                                  61
",61,2
"Examples of the fallacy are to say the brain knows something, the brain thinks, the brain
interprets, the brain makes decisions, and so on. What we mean in all these cases is that the
mind knows something, and so on (Bennett & Hacker, 2003).
      There is a type of metaphor called a metonym where one word is used for another very
closely associated with it, such as calling the judiciary or the judges ‘the bench’, or calling
business executives ‘suits’. One might say that we could use “brain” for “mind” in this
metaphorical sense. The trouble is speaking metaphorically can lead us into confusion; and
after a while, we might come to think that it is the brain that is thinking and feeling, and that
really there is no problem to solve. Science thrives on the exact usage of language, and sloppy
usage is its enemy.
       The mereological fallacy is very easy to fall into. Sometimes my brain doesn’t know what
it’s thinking.
Qualia
                              ft
      Philosophers have given a name to the elements that make up a subjective experience:
qualia. (“Qualia” is plural, with singular “quale”.) Examples of qualia are our experience of
D
the orange of a sunset, the red of a rose, the blue of the sky, the scent of a rose, the pain of
accidentally jabbing a finger with a needles, the taste of a nice cup of coffee, the sound of a
guitar, and the feel of your shoes around your feet. Open your eyes (and ears and mouth) and
 ra
qualia are everywhere.
     Qualia make up our experience - our experience of a rose is the sum of its qualia. But as
we have observed before, our experience is private. You cannot describe the colour red to
someone who has never experienced it before. And how do you know that you see red in the
same way I do?
     Another way of phrasing the hard problem is how can the nervous system generate qualia.
What objective physical processes are responsible for the purely mental and completely
subjective qualia?
Try this
      Choose something with prominent qualia, such as the red rose (see Figure 2.1). How
would you describe it to someone else. How would you describe colour to someone without
sight?

     Stop and consider your environment. How many qualia can you become aware of? Can
you be aware of more than one at a time?

DUALISM AND MONISM
      Mind and matter seem to be so fundamentally different that it’s reasonable to wonder if
they are different kinds of substance. This idea - that there are two sorts of substance - is called
dualism, and has a long and respectable history. The alternative is that there is only one kind
                               ft
of stuff, an idea called monism, so mind must somehow arise from matter, or matter from
mind, or are different aspects of some other kind of substance.
D
René Descartes and substance dualism
 ra
       Dualism has a long tradition, dating back to ancient Eastern philosophies, the ancient
Greek philosopher Plato, and religious traditions. The idea was most clearly articulated by the
French philosopher René Descartes in 1641 (Figure 2.4). Descartes thought that the body, like
all other matter, is made out of a material substance he called res extensa (it extends into the
world), while the mind is made out of an immaterial substance he called res cogitans. Res
extensa is the physical world we can reach out and touch; it is what’s made out of quarks and
atoms. Res cogitans, the mental stuff, is what we experience and what constitutes our
consciousness. The type of dualism, in which mind and matter are different types of substance,
is called substance dualism (often called Cartesian dualism).
      Substance dualism is appealing to many non-scientists because it fits in so well with what
we experience. And for those who believe in the soul, mental stuff is a solution consistent with
the idea of a permanent soul that can survive death. Some argue that Substance dualism could
also provide an account of some anomalistic phenomena such as extrasensory perception and
telepathy, although the scientific evidence for these phenomena is virtually non-existent, so
almost certainly there is nothing that needs explaining. Substance dualism does provide an
answer of sorts to the hard problem: physical matter doesn’t give rise to private experience at
all because private experience takes place within the realm of mental matter.
      There are two major problems with substance dualism. First, the mental material is
outside the realm of physics: we have no idea what constitutes it, and it cannot be examined by
                                                   63
",63,2
"physical or scientific methods. We are left with no way of making any further progress in the
subject: mind must remain an eternal mystery. The second issue is even more problematic: how
do mind and matter interact? Why is it that when you accidentally hurt yourself, such as
stubbing your toe, does the object hitting your toe give rise to a sensation of pain in your
awareness? How is it that when your mental stuff decides to raise a finger, the finger then goes
up?
      Descartes recognised this problem and argued that the soul interacts with the brain and
world through the pineal gland, a small gland positioned near the centre of the head (see Figure
2.2). Descartes seems to have chosen the pineal gland for reasons that were known to be
incorrect even at the time: that it was in the middle of the ventricles, the cavities in the grey
matter of the brain (whereas it actually hangs from the underside of the brain) and that it is
surrounded by arteries (whereas it was known from the time of the Greek philosopher and
surgeon Galen, b. 129 CE, that it is surrounded by veins). Descartes thought that the movement
of the pineal gland could cause movement in the ventricles, blood flow, and eventually
muscles. We know this biology is totally implausible, and there remains no mechanism by
                               ft
which mental matter could interact with physical matter.
Figure 2.2. The pineal gland, which Descartes believed was the location of the
interaction between mind and matter.
Dra
Other types of dualism
      Attempts other than Descartes’s to account for the interaction between mind and matter
sound no less plausible. One idea, called parallelism, is that the physical and mental worlds
have run in perfect unison from the start of time -- like two enormous clocks, set up by God
and kept in perfect synchrony. Another idea, called occasionalism, is that a rather busy God
makes sure that every time something happens in the physical world, the corresponding thought
or feeling happens in everyone’s mental world.
      For scientists seeking a simple, physical explanation without resort to divine intervention,
the failure of substance dualism, in spite of any popular and intuitive appeal, to explain how
the mind and material interact is a fatal flaw.
      A few brave scientists have nevertheless attempted to produce a rigorous account of
dualism. Perhaps the best known is the Nobel Prize winning Australian physiologist and
philosopher Sir John Eccles (1903 - 1997). Eccles was motivated by a strong Christian faith,
and a belief that mind and matter must be different substances. He proposed that the cortex
consists of fundamental units he called dendrons; each dendron is made up of a vertical
cylindrical bundle of neurons, each cylinder being about 60 micrometers (60 millionths of a
                                                  64
",64,2
"metre) in diameter. Groups of dendrons (about 40 million of them) link to a corresponding
mental unit he called a “psychon” (Beck & Eccles, 1992; Eccles, 1994). Eccles proposed that
psychons, through quantum mechanical-like processes, affect the release of neurotransmitters.
The interactions are small and undetectable, so as not to violate physical conservation laws that
say overall matter and energy are not lost or created in a system. But because these interactions
are undetectable, they are forever destined to be outside the realms of science.
     The problem with all substance dualism accounts is that our understanding of the physical
laws of the universe, although not complete, is extremely good, and those laws do not seem to
allow room for anything else. We already understand all the forces acting on protons, atoms,
and molecules. The behaviour of neurons is also completely explicable in terms of the laws of
physics. Saying that there is scope for some other influence on these elements other than the
known physical laws would involve a revolution in physics for which there is no other basis.
       Other kinds of dualism, in addition to substance dualism, have been proposed. The most
popular is property dualism, which says that although there is only one kind of substance in the
                              ft
world -- physical substance -- there are two kinds of properties: physical and mental properties.
An example of property dualism is emergentism, the idea that when matter is organised in
certain complex ways, new kinds of property, such as mental properties can emerge.
Emergentism is a popular recent idea, and we’ll be looking at it again later. Property dualists
say that although there is only one kind of substance, mental phenomena cannot be reduced to
D
physical phenomena. Examples are colour and heat: although a colour may be defined by the
frequency of the light, the colour we perceive cannot be reduced to frequency; and although
heat and warmth are defined by the kinetic molecular energy of the the material, the heat we
 ra
feel is something else.
Monism
      The alternative to dualism is monism -- the idea that there is only one sort of substance
in the world. One monist theory, known as idealism, is that the world is fundamentally mental,
or an idea. This is associated with the Irish philosopher Bishop Berkeley (1685 - 1753).
Berkeley argued that material objects exist only in the mind of the perceiver -- and even if no
person perceives these objects, God is still doing so.
      Although impossible to rule out, idealism now seems a fanciful and unnecessary
explanation. So most scientists, psychologists, and philosophers now prefer a type of substance
monism, where the only substance that exists is physical matter governed by the laws of
physics, an approach known as materialism. (Materialism is also known as physicalism.
Strictly speaking, materialism says that there is only physical matter, whereas physicalism says
that there are only physical matter and the laws of physics. Many people now use the words
interchangeably, and they are used interchangeably in this text.) Materialism/physicalism is
                                                  65
",65,2
"appealing because we need to consider only one type of matter, so there is no issue about how
anything interacts with anything else other than through the laws of physics, and all of
consciousness research remains within the realms of natural science. Most contemporary
consciousness researchers favour some form of materialism. We are left though with the hard
problem of how private experience arises from physical matter.
      Another view is that there is only one kind of substance, and mind and matter are different
ways of viewing or organising that substance. This view is called neutral monism, and a
variant of it anomalous monism.
Box 2.2. The History of Physics
     The laws of physics describe how matter and forces behave everywhere in the universe
across all time. These laws constitute a fundamental limitation on our behaviour and on the
                               ft
universe. As Scotty says in Star Trek, “You cannae change the laws of physics”.
     Although the principles of physics themselves are unchanging across time, our
understanding of them has changed considerably throughout history. We can describe three
main phases.
D     In the pre-scientific phase, as captured by the reasoning of the ancient Greeks, primarily
Aristotle, the laws were based on observation and intuition. However, our intuitions are often
wrong, and without testing of the hypotheses, incorrect assumptions are made and incorrect
 ra
conclusions drawn. The Greeks thought, for example, that it was obvious that if something is
moving at a constant velocity, then force is being continuously applied to it, and when that
force is no longer being applied, it will stop. If you roll a ball along the ground it eventually
comes to a stop. Similarly, they thought that if you dropped a feather and a cannon ball from
the top of a tower, the cannon ball, being heavier, would land first. The pre-scientific phase
endured for thousands of years.
      The scientific phase began in the sixteenth century with the realisation by Copernicus,
Kepler, and Galileo that the earth was not the centre of the universe, but that the earth moves
around the sun. Some earlier philosophers had postulated a heliocentric view of the world, but
these scientists were the first to use observational data to construct a model of the solar system
and to formulate the ideas mathematically. Kepler, for example, worked out that the orbits of
the planets around the sun, as shown, are shapes called ellipses, not circles.
      The task of explaining why these mathematical equations were as they were fell to Sir
Isaac Newton (1642-1727). He postulated that objects acting under forces according to his
three famous laws: every object stays at rest or travels at constant velocity in a straight line
unless a force acts upon it; force equals mass times acceleration; and for every action there is
equal and opposite and equal reaction. Newtonian (or classical) mechanics provides a superb
account of the behaviour of objects at rest and in motion. In everyday situations the account of
                                                  66
",66,2
"what happens is perfect, limited only by the accuracy of our measurements. Classical
mechanics does such a good job of accounting for the world that it was said that there is nothing
new to discover in physics now; physical science is now just a matter of making measurements
to an increasing number of decimal places.
      Then, Einstein’s miraculous papers in 1905 made it clear that superb though classical
mechanics is in everyday situations, it breaks down in explaining phenomena occurring at very
high speeds and large distances, where relativity comes into play, and at very small, sub- atomic
distances, where quantum mechanical effects come into play. Quantum mechanics says that
energy is not continuous, but comes in very small packets, that there are limitations on how
accurately we can measure things, and that some effects are best described probabilistically.
     The laws of physics are important because they provide a complete account of how the
universe behaves. This point is worth contemplating; there is no wiggle room.

THE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT        ft
D
about different sorts of stuff interacting, but seems not to provide an answer to the hard
problem: how can physical matter give rise to subjectivity, qualia, and private experience?
 ra
     Materialist monism has the virtue of simplicity, and doesn’t suffer from any problem
     Perhaps we’re overestimating the difficulty of the hard problem. We need to explore the
problems more thoroughly, and a few thought experiments will clarify what is at stake.
The ""Mary"" colour thought experiment
      The following thought experiment was devised by the philosopher Frank Jackson, and is
called the knowledge argument (because Mary, the protagonist of the story, has complete
knowledge of the world but limited experience of it). Let’s imagine a woman we call Mary
(Jackson, 1986). Mary has been brought up by an evil philosopher, and let’s call him Frank.
Before opening her eyes at birth, Mary was given a special pair of contact lenses that turns the
world monochrome, so that she only ever sees the world in black, white, and shades of grey.
Figure 2.6 approximates Mary’s vision of a red rose.
      Mary devotes her life to studying everything to do with colour vision -- the physics of
colour, the biology of colour vision, the neuroscience of colour vision--and by the time she’s
thirty-five she knows everything there is to know about how humans see colour. It might well
be that to understand colour vision properly she will have to end up learning everything there

"is to know about the world, but Mary is extremely clever and has a phenomenal memory, and
plenty of time. Then on her thirty-fifth birthday she is given a red rose and her contact lenses
are taken out. What will Mary say? Will she learn anything new about colour, or not? Will she
say “Oh, that’s just how I thought red would look” or will she say “Wow! So that’s red!”?
     Stop for a moment and think before you read on. What do you think she would say?
     Look at the image of the red rose to focus your thoughts.
      Many people think that Mary’s experience will be a total surprise to her, and she will say
“Wow!” For these people, qualia, the private sensations of experiencing red and other colours,
are not part of the physical world. All of Mary’s complete understanding of the physical laws
of the universe could not prepare her for the sensation of actually seeing the colour red. If that
is our belief, we must reject physicalism, the idea that all knowledge can be derived from
physical properties of the universe, as Jackson suggests.

For and against physicalism
      For many people the idea that actually experiencing colour adds to our knowledge of
colour sounds so immediately correct that they are surprised to learn that some leading
researchers disagree with it. Perhaps the most extreme position in favour of physicalism is
taken by Dennett (1991), who argues that Mary will not be at all surprised by the experience
of the redness of the rose. He believes that the nature of sensation is indeed derivable from
complete knowledge of the world. It is easy to say Mary would be surprised without really
appreciating the enormousness of complete knowledge -- something we can’t really
comprehend. Dennett’s approach is certainly one way of answering the hard question -- by
saying there isn’t really a hard question after all.
      Another approach is to say that Mary does learn something new, but that this in itself
does not reject physicalism. One way to argue this point is to say that Mary doesn’t learn any
new facts, but she learns about old facts in new ways. We can illustrate this idea with the
following two sentences about a popular Marvel comics character and his secret identity:
                                                  68
",68,2
"“Iron Man can zoom up into the atmosphere.” “Tony Stark can zoom up into the
atmosphere.”
      Both are saying the same thing if you know that Tony Stark and Iron Man refer to the
same entity. If you didn’t know before, though, that Iron Man is Tony Stark, when you do find
that out, you’re learning to look at the world in a different way. Needless to say, this argument
is controversial. You are learning a new fact, that Iron Man and Tony Stark are the same thing,
so before your knowledge of the world was incomplete
      A much-discussed variant of this argument was proposed by Paul Churchland (2004),
who makes use of the philosopher Bertrand Russell’s (1910) distinction between knowledge-
by-description and knowledge-by-acquaintance. If we read everything there is to know about
giraffes, including an accurate verbal description of what one looks like, we have knowledge
by description. But if we visit a zoo to see one, only then do we have knowledge by
acquaintance. In all these cases, Churchland would say, we haven’t exactly learned new
knowledge, but it’s clear that actually seeing a giraffe, or swimming in water, is different from
                              ft
just reading about these activities.
      Finally, some people deny that it is possible to learn everything about the world by
teaching alone; they feel that we may be able to acquire some physical knowledge only by
experience. For them the premise that Mary knows everything there is to know about the world
D
is incorrect (Alter, 1998). So the contention that “Mary knows everything” about colour is
simply false because experience is part of knowledge and Mary has been deprived that
knowledge.
 ra   In spite of the attempts at rebuttal, for many people the knowledge argument is one of the
strongest arguments against materialism.
      We should note that sometimes people who were blind from birth (because of congenital
cataracts) or deaf from birth acquire through treatment the ability to see or hear later in life.
Their response to gaining the new sense is understandably extreme, ranging from joy to
confusion. These experiences tell us nothing about Mary’s plight, however, because no one
would say these people had a complete physical account of what they were missing beforehand.
THE INVERTED COLOUR SPECTRUM
      The essence of the idea of private knowledge is that we can never really be certain what
another person is experiencing. How do you know that when you see the colour red that you
experience the same thing as someone else who says they too are seeing something ’red’?
Suppose instead when you have the sensation of seeing red, the other person has the same
sensation as you have when you see ‘green’? Or that when I look at a rainbow, I see the colours
in the same easy as you do? This idea is called the inverted spectrum, and it dates back to the
                                                  69

"English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704). The idea is that the perception of colours could
be systematically changed between people, and no one would be able to tell. As there is no way
of describing the sensation of colours, we are left once again with the conclusion that qualia
are real and ineffable (they cannot be expressed in words).
       It doesn’t seem plausible that we can tell how we perceive colours by looking at our brain
states: what would we look for in the visual system that tells us how we’re experiencing a
particular colour? There is nothing to look for in the brain because the brain is a physical system
and our experience of colours a purely private experience. So we seem to be forced to accept
again that because we can conceive of colours being inverted and there is no physical way of
telling if that has happened, there is something non-physical going on and we must accept the
existence of qualia. Knowledge of qualia is something over and above our knowledge of the
physical world. One person who doesn’t like the idea at all, and thinks the inverted spectrum
argument is “absurd” and “ridiculously” incoherent is the American cognitive scientist Douglas
Hofstadter (Hofstadter, 2007). He gives examples of several other inversions and asks, Do they
really make sense? The most interesting is the inverted sonic spectrum; we have a simple
                               ft
continuum of high to low frequency sounds, where very low notes can shake the room, and
very high notes, in Wagner’s operas, for example, pierce us to the core. Is it really possible that
I feel the high notes in the way that you feel the low notes, and vice versa? For Hofstadter the
problem is in believing that we can have pure experiences that are detached from the brain and
D
anything else in the world; he can’t conceive of them. Philosophers pick on the electromagnetic
spectrum and talk about inverted colours, because inverted sounds seem so grounded in the
world. But it’s just this question of whether sensations are attached to anything physical that’s
at stake.
 ra    You may think that we can say something about colours: red is a bit like orange, for
example, and is closer to yellow than blue, while green seems to be closer to blue than orange.
Red seems warm, while green seems cooler. In our example, the colour spectrum has been
systematically inverted, however, so the references to other colours change too. One way of
thinking about this is to imagine that the rainbow is inverted, so that all the in-between colours
shift too. Or we could swap opposite points on a colour wheel. And of course the feeling of
warmth one person gets from red and orange, another person would get from green and blue,
and vice versa.
      We know a tremendous amount about the neuroscience of vision; is it really plausible
that none of this knowledge is of any use in being able to tell us what we feel when we see red?
Here for a change science does come to our help, at least a little. Colours can be described in
terms of a colour space. There are different ways of covering the range of colours, but one easy
way of doing so is to use hue (the underlying frequency, or the position on the rainbow, which
is the main determinant of the colour), saturation (how pure the colour is, or how much it is
mixed with white light), and lightness (how bright it is, or how far away it is from black). It’s
possible to specify any colour in a space with these three dimensions. Moreover, human colour
vision is not equally sensitive to all colours. For example, it turns out there are more
                                                   70
",70,2
"perceptually distinguishable colours between red and blue than there are between green and
yellow. So if we were to invert red and green we would be able to detect the inversion
behaviourally by asking the person to make judgements about small differences in colours.
And whereas dark blue is a shade of blue, a dark yellow is what we call brown. It’s possible
that there are sufficient asymmetries in colour space to make it impossible to find an inversion
that is behaviourally undetectable (Clark, 1985, Hardin, 1993). A glance at the colour systems
developed by commercial enterprises like Pantone and NCS Group gives an idea of the range
of colours we’re capable of seeing (see Figure 2.4).
       Could we take the argument further, and, if we were sufficiently knowledgeable, describe
any colour uniquely to another person in terms of its position relative to its neighbours by
reference to asymmetries? So perhaps spectrum inversion isn’t a good argument for qualia after
all. And if inversion doesn’t work for colour, why should it work for any other spectrum of
experience? For example, how do I know that what a lemon tastes like to me is what it tastes
like to you? Perhaps we could eventually place its taste by reference to other tastes and their
asymmetries relative to their neighbours. Maybe the inverted spectrum argument isn’t a very
                               ft
good argument for the ineffable, private nature of qualia after all. On the other hand, there does
still seem to be something left over about the redness of red and the greenness of green that
isn’t captured by their relation to other colours, as the knowledge argument shows.

THE PROBLEM OF PAIN
      Think back to any painful experience. What did the pain feel like, and how would you
describe the pain to others? Pain appears to share a quality with other qualia: it is eventually
private and ineffable - you can’t explain it in words. In essence, you cannot really feel my pain
- my pain is private.
The physical aspect of pain
     Pain has both a physical and a mental aspect in that we have the subjective experience of
pain which seems to correspond to particular activity in the nervous system,. We know a great
deal about the neuroscience of pain. Pain originating from an external stimulus is called
nociceptive pain, and it occurs when a stimulus (heat, cold, sharpness, crushing force, or
chemical) approaches harmful intensity. When the stimulus exceeds a certain threshold, nerve
endings called nociceptors fire and the signal is passed to the spinal cord and then the brain.
                                                  71
",71,2
"There are two main types of nociceptors: A-fibres, which transmit an electrical signal very
quickly, and C-fibres, which are not protected by a myelin-sheath, and as a consequence
transmit a signal relatively slowly.
      If you jab your finger or accidentally touch something hot, the first thing that happens is
that you move your hand away very quickly. This quick motion occurs because of a reflex and
because of the way the A-fibre nociceptors are connected to motor neurons at the spinal cord.
The sensation of pain comes a bit later -- maybe quite a bit later-- and then persists. At the same
time the C-fibres project (transmit information) to the spinal cord, where that information is
then relayed to the brain stem and thalamus, before being processed by the rest of the brain.
The slow conductive speed of the C-fibres explains the delay between a painful event and the
feeling of pain, and why we often feel pain in two phases, a sudden sharp pain followed by a
dull ache akin to burning. We can then describe our response to a painful stimulus in a
biological causal chain (greatly simplified in this telling) that is very well understood. The
trouble is that this chain doesn’t appear to need the feeling of pain.
                               ft
      The processes involved in pain are much more complex than this overview suggests. The
peripheral nervous system has a “gates” that can limit the transmission of pain signal (Melzack
& Wall, 1965). It is also now well known that the body produces opiate-like chemicals known
as endorphins that inhibit the transmission of pain signals and can even produce feelings of
euphoria. While important for understanding the physiology of pain, these further details are
D
sideshows to the main issue of what pain is and why it hurts.
 ra
The mental aspect of pain
      Pain is a particularly interesting example of sensation because the sensation of pain is
clearly associated with a very distinct physical state, so that all and only people with C-fibres
firing will say they’re in pain. Is pain anything more than C-fibres firing? Of course, because
we do seem to have this additional sensation of pain. The issue then is the relationship of the
feeling of pain to this very clearly defined physical state.
      Now more questions arise. Could we have evolved with the aversive physical nature of
pain but without the sensation of it hurting? Or could it even be that if someone jabbed you
with a pin, you would draw your hand away and say “Ouch” but inside you would feel nothing?
Suppose that you take a particularly effective painkiller and your physical state is otherwise
the same, but you feel no pain. Would you still say you’re in pain then? And given that we
have a fairly detailed physiological account of pain, and can use brain imaging to see which
parts of the brain become activated by painful stimuli, would we then want to go further and
say that the feeling of pain is located in that specific area of the brain? Moreover, when we say,
“I feel a pain in my arm after you jabbed me,” do we really feel the pain there? Surely the pain
arises after processing in the brain?
                                                   72
",72,2
"At this point, you might say, “Look, this is all very well, and quite entertaining, but it’s a
bit theoretical and a bit silly really; I know what the world is like for me, and of course it’s
surely the same for everyone else. If you jab me with a pin, I will feel pain in just the same way
as you will if I jab you.” This argument is called the argument by analogy to the existence of
other minds. There are two rejoinders to your scepticism. The first is that you may think you
know what others feel, but you could never be certain. The second is that as the Austrian
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951) pointed out, Why should there be anything
special about you (Wittgenstein, 1953)? He called this kind of generalisation irresponsible: just
because I am a certain way, why should I be so special that everyone else is like me, too?
       In a rare condition called congenital analgesia, affected individuals are incapable of
feeling pain. These individuals are very prone to injury and infection because they do not
receive the warning signals that the rest of us get from pain. Furthermore, some drugs such as
morphine cause people to report that they are still experiencing extreme pain, but also that it is
not unpleasant -- a state we call a dissociation. Hence it seems that either we are wrong to think
that people cannot be mistaken about being in pain (that is, wrong about what we call the
                               ft
infallibility of our sensations), or that pain need not necessarily be aversive (that is, wrong
about the intrinsic awfulness). Dennett suggests that our concept of pain is so defective that it
doesn’t refer to anything real - which is, he argues, why we could never make a computer feel
pain (Dennett, 1978b).

Try this
 ra   You have built an extremely sophisticated human-like robot. Naturally you want it to stay
safe and have some sophisticated means of self- preservation; who having spent years of their
lives and millions of dollars wants their creation to sit up and walk straight into a fire. What
would you need to do to ensure the robot avoids harm? Is knowledge of the world, that it should
not walk off tall buildings or into fire, enough? But then what about surprising stimuli, such as
hot pans and unexpected sharp objects? Is the ability to withdraw from the dangerous stimulus
enough, or would you need to programme it to feel pain as well? And if so, how could you do
so?
Pain in babies
      Until recently there has been considerable controversy about whether or not babies feel
pain. It might seems obvious to us now that they do, but until the mid 1980s it was,
unbelievably, routine to operate on babies without giving them an anaesthetic or analgesic (de
Lima, Lloyd-Thomas, Howard, Sumner, & Quinn, 1996). To be fair one of the issues was that
anaesthetics are more dangerous for babies, so it was thought important to giving them when
                                                   73
",73,2
"it was not considered necessary, and it was not considered necessary because it was believed
that the nervous system of infants is not fully developed. Now safer anaesthetic protocols
means that infants can be anaesthetised with greater confidence about their safety. In addition
our understanding about the neurology of infants and foetuses is much more advanced.
     Research now shows that foetuses appear to feel pain. The argument is that the brain
systems supporting pain, particularly the cortex and appropriate connections to it, are not fully
developed before the twenty seventh week (Lee, Ralston, & Drey, 2005).
P-ZOMBIES
       Zombies are everywhere these days: they’re all the rage in movies and shoot ‘em up
games, poor things. For our purposes a zombie is a person who is behaviourally
indistinguishable from us, but who does not have consciousness. A zombie does not experience
                               ft
sensations such as those of seeing the colour red or of feeling pain, and while it is like
something to be like me (and presumably you), the same isn’t true of zombies. It isn’t like
anything to be a zombie. By “behaviourally indistinguishable” we mean there is no behavioural
test that would tell us the zombie is conscious or not. If we jabbed it with a needle, it would
D
cry out in pain (and maybe take a swipe at us); it would claim that it thought it was seeing red
just like anyone else; and if we asked it whether it was conscious, it would insist that of course
it was, and possibly express badly hurt feelings that we could doubt such a thing. Nothing
would expose its lack of consciousness. But inside the zombie wouldn’t actually feel any pain
 ra
- it would just exhibit pain behaviour. As we’re talking about zombies in a specific sense here,
we can call them “philosophical zombies,” or “p-zombies” for short.
Is consciousness essential?
     Do you think a p-zombie is possible? Stop a moment to think about your answer.
      If you think a p-zombie could in principle exist, then because p-zombies behave exactly
like conscious entities, we have no way of distinguishing conscious from non-conscious things.
Consciousness is therefore something else on top that doesn’t do anything: it is a nonessential
extra. The most significant philosopher to have argued that p-zombies are possible is David
Chalmers (1996), who uses the argument to conclude that physicalism must be false.
Unfortunately, the conclusion also seems to follow that consciousness doesn’t play any causal
role in our physical states, a position called epiphenomenalism.
     If you think a p-zombie cannot exist, then you are committed to the notion that
consciousness serves some essential function: someone can’t behave like a conscious person
                                                  74
",74,2
"unless that someone is truly conscious. In that case you have to be prepared to answer questions
such as, Why is consciousness essential? and What is its function? Several philosophers have
argued that p-zombies cannot exist, including Owen Flanagan (1992) and Patricia Churchland
(1996).
Being conceivable
      The possible existence of p-zombies is one of the most controversial thought experiments
in the philosophy of mind. Neither of the positions just described - that consciousness is a non-
essential extra or that it serves some function - is immediately appealing. Another way out of
the problem of p-zombies is to say that it’s meaningless to talk about them in the first place. It
is useful at this point to make a distinction between something being conceivable and
something being possible. Something is conceivable in that we can imagine it in the first place.
                               ft
Only if something is conceivable can we move on to considering whether it is actually possible.
The idea that we can speak meaningfully about p-zombies depends on the idea that they are in
fact conceivable. Some though argue that p-zombies are not in fact conceivable: they’re
inconceivable, if you like. Perhaps the most notable proponent of the inconceivability argument
is Daniel Dennett (1995). He argues that if we think we can conceive of a p-zombie, we are in
D
fact mistaken.
      Dennett mounts several arguments against the conceivability of p-zombies, essentially
saying that consciousness isn’t a single thing that can be simply dispensed with, but a huge
 ra
complex of mental states, behaviours, and dispositions, and people who think we can do
without it underestimate the difficulty of the task of doing so. You cannot, for example, remove
the hurt from pain and have a thing behave in the same way; it just isn’t possible, says Dennett.
So if p-zombies are not conceivable, it makes no sense to talk about their existing: the problem
disappears. Needless to say, however, there is as little agreement on whether they are
conceivable as on whether they are possible.
       The arguments about the viability or not of p-zombies shows the essential difference
between real and thought experiments: with real experiments, we just look at the data. With
thought experiments, we can have different intuitions, and each of us thinks our intuition is
right.
MATERIALISM
     Suppose we reject dualism. Somehow we then have to make a monist materialist position
work: the mind has to be explained in purely physical terms if it is completely dependent on
                                                  75
",75,2
"the brain and nothing else. How then do we deal with qualia and private, subjective experience?
That is, how do we solve the hard problem? The preceding thought experiments show how
difficult it is going to be to accommodate subjective experience into a physicalist framework.
There are two different approaches - reductive materialism and eliminative materialism.
Reductive materialism
      Reductive materialism reductionism is the idea that we can explain one level of
theorisation with lower-level theories. So we can explain the behaviour of atoms in terms of
sub-atomic particles and quantum mechanics; we can explain chemistry in terms of physics;
and we can explain biology in terms of chemistry and physics. We can eventually reduce
behaviour to the operation of the brain, and the brain to biology and hence to physics. So
reductive materialism says that all sensory experience can be explained in terms of, or reduced
                               ft
to, physical activity in the brain. At the moment this line of argument is very much “in
principle” for complex biological systems because the practicality of reducing phenomena at
one level to a lower one is overwhelming.
       Perhaps the simplest approach to physicalism is to deny that there is much of a problem
D
at all, and assert that mental states are identical with brain states. That is, sensations and brain
processes refer to the same thing. This approach is often called mind-brain identity theory.
There are different versions of identity theory, but the most popular and most discussed is
 ra
called type identity theory. According to type identity theory, mental events can be grouped
into types, such as being in pain, and these types of mental events can be correlated with types
of brain states, such as C-fibres firing. According to identity theory the mental state of being
in pain is identical with the physical state of C-fibres firing.
      One of the most famous statements of type identity theory was put forward by the
Australian philosopher J.J.C. Smart (1959). Smart was particularly impressed by the parsimony
of identity theory. In science, the parsimony principle holds that the simplest explanation for a
phenomenon is preferred. So if there is no very good reason to do so, why should we introduce
anything else in addition to brain states to explain qualia? The strongest objection to identity
theory is that the same mental state might be realised by different physical states: perhaps the
physiology of the pain system is very different between humans and, say, birds (Putnam, 1988).
And if we one day encounter aliens, it is most unlikely that they will have evolved C-fibres
like our, yet they will almost certainly be capable of feeling pain. And who is to say that one
day a silicon-based robot might not be capable of feeling pain? Pain does appear to be more
than simply C-fibres firing.
                                                   76
",76,2
"Eliminative materialism
       The second approach, pioneered by the philosophers Daniel Dennett (1988), Paul
Churchland (1981, 1988), Patricia Churchland (1986), and Georges Rey (1997), is called
eliminative materialism. It makes the bold claim that our everyday understanding of mental
states is wrong. This approach is particularly well exemplified in Dennett’s paper “Quining
Qualia.” Now, no one could doubt that qualia exist; after all, the fact that I have a sensation of
red when I look at something red is unquestionable -- to me. It is giving qualia any special
status in science that Dennett objects to; he instead argues that we should not reject materialism
because it in some way fails to account for qualia (or “reduce” them to lower level phenomena).
Instead, Dennett argues, materialism is perfectly consistent with the existence of qualia; there
just isn’t a problem. He gets rid of the problem of qualia so by “quining” them, coining the
verb “to quine”, defined as “to deny resolutely the existence or importance of something real
or significant”, in honour of the great American philosopher W.V.O. Quine (1908-2000), who
argued against the philosophical reality of another seemingly important distinction (the analytic
                               ft
- synthetic distinction, the details of which need not concern us).
       Dennett makes this argument using an ‘intuition pump’. Here is an example: imagine two
chaps who enjoy a particular cup of coffee. After a few years they agree that the coffee isn’t as
good as it used to be. One says the flavour of the coffee has remained constant, but his response
D
to that flavour has changed, so he no longer enjoys it; the other says that the flavour has
changed, so he no longer enjoys it. One says the quale has remained the same but his response
to it has changed; the other says the quale has changed. Can we distinguish the two views?
 ra
They can’t both be right, says Dennett, so which one of them is right? The problem is insoluble:
One of the two people must be wrong about his own quale, but doesn’t know so.
      Dennett’s approach has perhaps not surprisingly generated much debate, and many would
take issue with some of the steps in his argument (see, for example, Flanagan, 1994). However,
this approach does show that at least some people believe that qualia are not an obstacle to a
completely materialist science. For Dennett, the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland,
and others the whole idea of qualia is so confusing and riddled with inconsistencies as to be
unusable. Their position is that since we know that our introspections are unreliable, this
everyday “folk” psychology has no place in modern science. Better to do without it.
      Whether or not side-stepping the problem gets rid of it though is debatable, and not
everyone is convinced. Although eliminative materialism appears counterintuitive to many,
philosophers have found it difficult to reject eliminative materialism to everyone’s satisfaction.
Folk psychology clearly has many problems; the ideas we use in everyday life do not always
stand up to scientific scrutiny.

"FUNCTIONALISM
       Perhaps we’re worrying too much about the detailed relationship between brain states
and mental states: maybe there are many ways in which they can be related. After all, there are
many ways of constructing a mouse trap: we have the classic spring that is sprung when a
mouse tries to remove the piece of cheese, or boxes whose lids flip shut when the mouse goes
in, or tubes that they can get into through the top but then can’t get out of again. All that matters
is what the mousetrap does: if it kills or captures the mouse, it’s a mousetrap. Similarly, it could
be that all human minds are similar: all that matters is what a particular mental state does, not
what it looks like. And if that’s true, the details of how mental states are realised physically are
irrelevant. It’s the function of mental states that matters. Functionalism is the idea that what
makes a mental state what it is depends only on its function, and the role it plays on the system;
it doesn’t depend on its internal constitution or how it is realised physically.

Silicon neurons and silicon brains
      We are all perfectly happy with hip replacements and artificial valves being fitted to us,
D
where our quality of life or even our lives are changed by artificial material. Some of us have
qualms though about extend these changes to the brain. Let’s start with a simple thought
experiment. Imagine we could manufacture a little silicon neuron. It works in exactly the same
 ra
way as a “real” neuron does; you can swap it for an existing brain cell, and it does just the same
thing, receiving inputs from neighbouring neurons, and firing and sending outputs to adjacent
neurons just as the “real” one would. Now, would you be troubled if we substituted the silicon
neuron for one of your biological ones? I certainly wouldn’t; it might even be more robust.
After all, all that matters is the function of the neuron, the way it works, not the details of how
it’s made.
      Perhaps you can see where this argument is going: why not substitute two silicon neurons
for two biological neurons in your brain, each connected to all the other neurons it should be
connected to? And if we can work out the wiring and figure out exactly which neurons are
connected to which, why not give us the transplant of a silicon hippocampus or silicon
hypothalamus? Indeed, why not swap in an appropriately connected silicon brain? most of us
would be happy with one or two silicon neurons, but we baulk at larger structures, and few are
happy with the idea of having a silicon brain swapped in. The point at which we start to say no
varies.
       With functionalism, the point is that it’s only function that matters. If the silicon brain is
behaving exactly like a biological brain, it doesn’t matter what the brain is made of, as long as
it is functioning in the same way. We have made enormous strides in the last few years in our
understanding of how the brain is wired, thanks in part to the Human Connectome Project (Van

       The neuron, or nerve cell (and sometimes spelled neurone), is a special type of cell which
is the basic unit of the nervous system, which comprises peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and
the brain. Like all cells, neurons have a body which is essentially a bag of chemicals, a nucleus
D
containing genetic material, and a semi-porous membrane that you can think of as the bag
itself. Unlike other cells, neurons also have two types of projection on their surface. Axons are
long thin “arms” that connect with other neurons. Dendrites are smaller flatter projections.
Axons transmit signals along the cell length while dendrites receive them from other cells.
 ra
Signals are transmitted along axons as electrical waves called potentials, with ions (charged
particles) of the elements sodium, potassium, and calcium being particularly important in the
transmission of the signal.
      Neurons do not touch other neurons directly but are separated by small gaps between the
axon and dendrite called synapses. Synapses contain special chemicals called
neurotransmitters, examples of which are serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and
noradrenaline. Neurons communicate through neurotransmitters and electrical signals,
although ultimately all communication results in a change in the electrical state of the cell.
      Axons are protected and insulated by a fatty substance called myelin. Because myelin is
an insulating material, a thick myelin sheath increases the speed at which an electrical impulse
is propagated along the the axon relative to a thinner myelin sheath. Disorders of myelin
formation and distribution lead to widespread central nervous system disorders, the best known
of which is multiple sclerosis.

The ""China brain"" thought experiment
      At least it seems sensible to ask whether a silicon brain might be conscious, but a thought
experiment called the Chinese Nation, or China Brain (Block, 1978), makes the question seem
daft for many people - until they think about it.. China is chosen because the population is so
large - at least 1.4 billion. The typical human brain has about 100 billion neurons, so it’s just a
couple of orders of magnitudes more. We let each person stand in for a neuron, and let them
communicate with other people with cell phones (or radios in earlier version), just as neurons
                               ft
communicate with one another by firing. In the brain, every time a neuron “fires”, it sends an
excitatory impulse to other neurons. In the same way, the person in the China brain
corresponding to such a neuron would phone up all the people to which he or she is connected,
and they would phone up their connections in turn, and so on. We could have people
D
corresponding to neurons receiving input from sensory neurons, and have others corresponding
to motor neurons if we wished, and we could even arrange a system to translate signals from
the world to sensory neurons and from motor neurons to the world. In effect, China would
constitute a brain.
 ra  Would the whole system—the China brain—be conscious? The property of
consciousness doesn’t reside in any individual neuron, but the brain as a whole, as a system;
what’s the difference between the human brain and an appropriately connected China brain?
      Some philosophers, Dennett (1991), for example, conclude that the China brain is a form
of mental state. Many others are less comfortable with that conclusion. In particular, Block
(1978) noted that although the whole system would receive an input, there would be nothing
corresponding to qualia. This conclusion is however questionable: no individual neuron feels
pain, but the mind, made out of many neurons, does. Why should a China brain be any
different?
      Following these examples, we can propose that mental states (such as beliefs, desires,
being in pain, and so on) are constituted solely by their functional role - what they do and what
they’re connected to do. Mental states are related to other mental states, sensory inputs, and
behavioural outputs only by virtue of the effects they have each other (what is known as their
causal role). This proposal is known as functionalism. (A word of warning: there are several
types of functionalism in psychology and sociology.)
                                                   80
",80,2
"Because all that matters is the causal role, the physical form of what implements mental
states does not matter, an idea known as multiple realisability. So a suitable silicon chip is as
good as a neuron. A China brain is as good as a brain as long as connected up appropriately.
The details of the implementation do not matter (an idea called organisational invariance), so
there is nothing special about the “wetware” of the brain.
       In my experience most students don’t like the idea of a nation itself, such as China in this
thought experiment, being conscious, but when pressed they find it difficult to explain why.
We shouldn’t think of the China brain working one neuron at a time; everyone is active
simultaneously. If the worry is about speed, we could have people on speed dials or even have
them send an immediate pulse to all the connected people. We can with a bit of imagination
get rid of any systematic difference between the human and China brain. In that case surely,
like the functionalist, we must conclude that the Chinese nation as a whole would be conscious.
Box 2.4. What is Computation?
                               ft
      In practice, computation is what a computer does. Given an input, the system follows a
set of rules to produce an output. To give a very simple example,
D
     2+3=5
     Given two numbers as the input, the arithmetic operation of addition gives an output. The
development of the theory of computation by the British mathematician Alan
 ra   Turing (1912 - 1954) and others, was essential for the development of the computer. A
computational system is a formal system in that it is a well-described system based on
mathematics. The rules a formal system follows are called the syntax of the system. Human
language has a complex system of syntactic rules for manipulating the words of a language;
the conveyance of meaning in language is the domain of semantics.
      Cognitive psychology, which developed in the sixties and seventies, took the computer
as a metaphor, viewing psychological processes as information processing – that is,
computation. The mind is given an input (for example, a pattern of light on a screen or on a
retina, or a spoken word) and by a series of transformations (computations) produces an output
(for example, the name of the object or access to the meaning of the spoken word). In this light,
the task of cognitive psychology is to specify the nature of the intermediate transformations or
computations, as well as the representational format of the inputs and outputs that the mind
uses. Thinking is often said to be symbol manipulation - symbols stand for something, such as
a representation of a dog standing for a dog. When we think we are manipulating these symbols.
      The extent to which this approach provides an adequate account of cognition and
psychology has become controversial. The essence of Searle’s Chinese room argument is that
specifying the syntactic rules of computation alone is inadequate for understanding behaviour,
                                                   81
",81,2
"and more consideration needs to be given to the semantics, and the way in which meaning in
the mind is related to objects, attributes, and events in the world.

Arguments against functionalism
      How does functionalism explain qualia? Some people think that there is something
special about the biological substrate (although it is not at all clear what it might be that is
special), and that a biochemical foundation is essential for qualia. The possibilities are (1) that
humans and other complex biological entities experience normal qualia (we will assume that
our qualia are similar); (2) that some systems, no matter how complex, will not have qualia, an
idea known as absent qualia; or (3) that a robot based on silicon chips might be conscious, but
its consciousness would be very different from us (an idea known as different or sometimes
                               ft
inverted qualia). As two things that are functionally identical can yet have different mental
states, functionalism cannot explain these individual differences in qualia.
      As Chalmers (1995) says, there is something of a stand-off: proponents of the idea that
there is something special about biochemical systems and that a China brain’s being conscious
D
is preposterous just have a very different view of the world from those who think that all that
matters is the way things are organised, and not how they are implemented. Both stick
steadfastly to their positions thinking they must be right. And in the end, who can know for
 ra
sure? Chalmers (1995), however proposes, an additional interesting thought experiment.
      Consider your biochemical self and a silicon isomorph (that is, identical duplicate) of
yourself in which all your neurons have been replaced by silicon chips that function in exactly
the same way as your neurons and have exactly the same pattern of connectivity. Let’s call this
copy MyRobot. A functionalist would say that MyRobot would be conscious and have exactly
the same experiences (and qualia) as you would in any situation. Some anti- functionalists
would say that MyRobot has absent qualia. Now let’s consider intermediate positions by
revisiting a previous thought experiment. We’ll take you and replace just one neuron (in the
left prefrontal cortex, say) with one of these super-duper silicon chips. As we have observed,
few people would say that this operation would make any difference to anything. Then we
gradually replace more neurons.
      At some point the anti-functionalist is committed to the point of view that something
changes. One possibility is that the qualia suddenly disappear, but if they do, at what point?
When just one biological neuron is left? That doesn’t sound right. Half way? We don’t know
exactly when, but at some point with some configuration we have suddenly disappearing
qualia. The other possibility is that the qualia gradually fade away the more we change, but
does that idea even make sense? When you burn your finger, you feel a most unpleasant pain;
                                                   82
",82,2
"will the iRobot just feel a slight ache? Will iRobot see a faded pink when you look at our trusty
red rose? And as we replace more neurons, the qualia fade away altogether. Does it even make
sense to talk of partial qualia? We can apply a similar thought experiment if we think that the
iRobot has qualia, but they are different --inverted, say. As we change the neurons into chips,
at what point do the qualia change? Do they suddenly flip over? Chalmers (1995) calls this
idea dancing qualia.
      Another substantial argument against functionalism is the Chinese room (Searle, 1980).
Functionalism is linked to the computational theory of mind, the idea that mental processing is
a matter of computation in the same way as a computer works through a program. Crucially
which computer you run the program on doesn’t matter: 2 + 2 always equals 4 regardless of
whether you’re using a Mac or PC. Searle call the idea that an appropriately programmed
computer has mental states ‘Strong AI’, and the Chinese room is one of the strongest arguments
against strong AI. Imagine we have a woman sitting in a room; her knowledge of foreign
languages is zero. In particular she knows nothing whatsoever about Chinese. In her room
though she has a set of rules that enable her to produce an appropriate written Chinese output
                              ft
for any Chinese input. Someone slips a piece of paper under one door; she goes to her book of
symbols and list of rules for manipulating those symbols, and by using just them, she creates
an output in Chinese, which she then slips under another door. To the outside world, it is as
though we have given the “room” something in Chinese, and it has understood it and produced
D
an answer in Chinese.
      But would we say that the woman inside understands Chinese? Of course not. We have
already said she doesn’t understand a word. She has just “blindly” been following a list of
 ra
rules. Searle argues strong AI is the same: the computers just blindly follow rules, but has no
understanding of what they are doing.
      The argument provoked many critical responses, and responses to those responses, and
as usual in consciousness research, there is no clear winner (see the original Searle article for
many peer responses). Most of the original protagonists just moved on to new problems. The
most common response is called the systems response; the woman might not understand
Chinese, but the entire room, the whole system, does. When you hear a word in English, no
single neuron can be said to understand English, but your whole brain clearly does. It’s the
system level that’s important. Searle’s response is that the system has to know about the
meaning of the symbols (the semantics): how the symbols refer to things, actions, and
properties in the world.The set of rules in the Chinese room is just a formal syntactic system
without semantics, meaning that the room manipulates the symbols without any idea of to what
they correspond. To be conscious, he argues, you need meaning, and only biological systems
have that. Although there are other responses to the Chinese room, the systems reply is the
most popular (see the chapter on the Chinese room in Dennett, 2014, for a recent account).

MYSTERIANISM
                               ft
      Most people with at least a little scientific education are uncomfortable with substance
dualism, so they usually conclude that they must be a kind of physicalist monist (that is, a
materialist) - although they might not use those words! The trouble is that materialism is prone
to all the sorts of problems that we’ve just looked at, particularly there doesn’t seem much
D
scope for the presence of feeling and experience something. Are there any other alternatives?
 ra
      One possibility is that, unlike the rest of the scientific domain, consciousness is beyond
human understanding. It might seem strange that something we all experience at first hand is
ultimately incomprehensible, but it’s not impossible. This type of approach is called the new
mysterianism, or simply just mysterianism. The proponents of mysterianism are called the
mysterians. The name comes directly from an 1960s American rock band (the band’s full name
was “? And the Mysterians”; yes, that’s a question mark), that in turn took its name from a
1957 Japanese science fiction film, The Mysterians. The original, old, mysterians were dualists
who thought that consciousness was a different type of substance that was therefore not subject
to the laws of physics. Here is an analogy to help you understand new mysterianism. William
James (1896) observed that dogs are in our life but not of it: all the time they experiencing
events that have meaning and purpose beyond their understanding. Imagine Beau looking at a
book; of course he could not be said to be reading it because it’s not just that he can’t read, but
that he has and can never have any comprehension of what reading is. Consciousness might be
for us like reading is for Beau.
      The most adamant proponent of new mysterianism is the British philosopher Colin
McGinn. He argues that nature may not have equipped the human brain with the ability to solve
the problems of consciousness; that is, nature has not provided us the apparatus to understand
ourselves (McGinn, 1989, 2000). When it is up against consciousness, science hits a brick wall,
what McGinn calls cognitive closure. McGinn doesn’t say that science simply can’t solve
consciousness at the moment, but that it necessarily never will: our minds are closed to it
                                                   84
",84,2
"because the subject is beyond our limits of understanding. We’re just not biologically capable
of understanding our own minds.
      Daniel Dennett, again has been a trenchant critic of mysterianism (e.g. Dennett, 1991b).
His objections are centred around the opinion that it is unduly pessimistic to conclude that
consciousness is beyond our understanding. Indeed, the history of science is full of examples
of problems that seemed intractable, or in fact even beyond our imaginings before their
discovery, such as quantum mechanics. Dennett also argues that the form of the argument of
new mysterianism is unscientific: people assert that we may never understand consciousness,
but that assertion is not in itself any proof or guarantee that we won’t.
      Nevertheless the list of adherents to mysterianism is impressive. Leading researchers who
have at least speculated that the explanatory gap between the generation of private experience
and what we know of the physics and biology of the brain is so large that it may never breached
include Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker, Martin Gardner, and Sam Harris.
       Another possible resolution of the mind-body problem is that we have we given up on
                              ft
dualism too soon. As we have seen, substance dualism isn’t the only type of dualism, although
it is the best known. Property dualism states that there is only one type of substance, but
physical and mental properties are two different sorts of category, neither of which can be
reduced to the other. Non-reductive materialism holds that while mental properties can be
D
mapped onto biological processes (pain in humans is associated with C-fibres firing), they
cannot be reduced to them (that’s not all there is). What though is the extra? While substance
dualism is relatively straightforward to understand, many people find property dualism much
 ra
more difficult to follow.

"CHAPTER SUMMARY
     • The philosophy of mind studies the way in which mind and brain are related, and how
 the matter of the brain might give rise to private experience, a topic known as the mind-
 body problem.
    • Instead of traditional experiments, philosophy particularly makes use of thought
 experiments.
    • Thought experiments help clarify problems and reveal our assumptions and beliefs
 about them.
    • Qualia (single quale) is the name given to raw sensations, the basic components of
 experience, such as the redness of a rose.
                            ft
    • As formulated by Descartes, dualism says that mind and matter are different types of
 substance, and that mind does not obey the laws of physics.
     • The main problem with dualism is in specifying how mind and matter interact.
D   • In contrast to dualism, monism says that there is only one kind of substance, matter or
 mind.
 ra
     • The problem facing physical monism lies in specifying how matter can give rise to
 private experience and qualia.
    • Physicalism and materialism are terms now used interchangeably, and say that
 everything is ultimately physical.
    • The Knowledge Argument asks us what we would need to know to be able to predict
 what a quale is like by considering Mary the neuroscientist.
     • The Knowledge Argument is often taken as an argument against physicalism.
    • Many are sceptical that Mary could know what a red rose was like before she
 experienced one.
    • There are though several rebuttals of the Knowledge Argument.
    • The most extreme rebuttal of the Knowledge Argument is Dennett’s which says that
 Mary would not be at all surprised by redness because it would be deducible from complete
 knowledge of the physical world.
     • The idea of the “inverted spectrum” asks whether it’s possible for one person to sense
 red where another person senses green, seeing the same thing, yet experiencing different
 qualia.
                                               86
",86,2
"• Pain is another example of a quale, and there has been much discussion over its
function.
    • Could we function just as well by withdrawing from some stimuli without those
stimuli causing a feeling of pain?
   • Could there b a hypothetical P-zombie (or philosophical zombie, or robot) that is
behaviourally indistinguishable from a human would also necessarily be conscious.
   • If you think a p-zombie could exist then we have no way of distinguishing conscious
from non-conscious things, and consciousness is therefore something else on top that
doesn’t do anything: it is a nonessential extra. It is said to be epiphenomenal.
   • A thing is conceivable if in principle we can grasp the concept, and the concept does
not involve any logical contradictions.
   • There has been considerable argument a to whether the philosophical zombie is
conceivable.
                           ft
   • Materialism is the doctrine that all human experience arises from one sort of
substance, and that substance is the matter studied in physics.
   • Type physicalism, reductive materialism, and mind-brain identity theory are different
D
names for the idea that a mental experience corresponds to a physical brain state, and nothing
more.
 ra
   • Eliminative materialism says that our everyday folk psychology beliefs about the
world are misleading, very poorly defined, or even plain wrong, and hence we as scientists
should not be too concerned about the subjective sensation of pain.
   • Functionalism is the idea that mental states are defined by what they do rather than
how they are made.
   • According to functionalism we could construct a mind from materials other than
neurons—for example, silicon or even a human population—as long as the “neurons” were
connected in the right way.
   • Many dispute that how a mind is constructed is irrelevant.
   • A famous counter-argument is Searle’s Chinese room thought experiment.
    • According to the mysterians, consciousness is beyond our understanding; the mind is
not equipped with the machinery to comprehend itself.
