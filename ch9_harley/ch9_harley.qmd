## Perception and Consciousness
- Empiricism
- Normal Visual Perception
- Disorders Of Visuo-Spatial Perception
- The Grand Illusion

## Empiricism
- Are you dreaming now?
- Are you being misled by a demon?

## The brain in a vat
- How do you know you’re a brain in a vat being fed information?

## Normal Visual Perception
- Normal vision involves a lot of “filling in”
   - E.g. we only “see” our blind spot in exceptional circumstances

## Constructing the visual world
- Bistable figures
- Binocular rivalry
- Change blindness and inattentional blindness
- Visual illusions
- No-report paradigm

## Try this: The Necker cube
- Examine the Necker cube in Figure 9.1. Do you see any reversals? Can you learn to reverse at will?
   - A bistable figure

## Try this: Phantom words
Search online for the Deutsch phantom words and Shepard tones. Try them. Also follow the instructions for the cutaneous rabbit - you’ll have to be fast though.

## Disorders Of Visuo-spatial Perception
- Blindsight
- Spatial neglect
- Synaesthesia
- Proprioception

## The Importance of Blindsight
- Weiskrantz
- Vision without awareness

## Two visual streams
- Ventral and Dorsal streams
   - “What” and “How” processing routes

## Visual-spatial neglect
- Brain damage means people are unable to attend to part or whole of one side of the world
- It is attentional (Bisiach & Luzzatti, 1978, Milan Piazza Del Duomo experiment)

## Synaesthesia
- Leakage across components of vision or modalities

---



## The Binding Problem
- How are percepts bound together to form stable objects?
- Visual awareness
- Importance of gamma waves (around 40 Hz)
- Areas of convergence of pathways in brain not properly identified
- Thalamo-cortical resonance (Llinas et al., 1998)

## Micro-consciousness
Zeki
- Modules of visual perception

## Visual awareness
- When does something enter visual awareness?
- The “Jennifer Aniston cell”
- Single neurons in the anterior medial temporal lobe

## The Grand Illusion
Noe
- A complete visual world is an illusion
- Perception is not like a multisensory movie

## Summary

- We do not have access to the inner processes of perception
- A complete visual world is an illusion
- The world doesn’t “really” look like how we see it
- Much is missing in our perceptions
