#### 1st: fMRI (high space-resolution to establish WHERE)  

- Unconscious/Preconscious: Sensory input according to processing that is highly localized to input modality: vision (occipital lobe), hearing (superior temporal lobe), somatosensory (anterior parietal lobe), etc

- Conscious processing: “all-or-nothing”, ignition, global broadcast, and re-entrant-amplified processing (Box 8.2 Cortex regions 1) Frontal, 2) inferotemporal, 3) midline/limbic, 4) (para)hippocampal , 5) Posterior Parietal)

#### 2nd: EEG (high time-resolution to establish WHEN)   
- Unconscious/Preconscious P1/N1 waves before 200ms post-stimulus, highly-localized by input modality
- Conscious processing: post-stimulus onset 200-250 ms: P300 brain wave
Appears frontally initially for novel stimuli (P3a), but globally for all conscious stimuli (P3b)

#### 3rd: (ECoG/invasive electrophysiology)  
- Gamma band + Theta : local coordinated activity multiplexed with lower amplitude band

#### 4th: (ECoG/invasive electrophysiology)
- Unconscious/Preconscious: early on restricted to thamocortical locations and short distance connections in same modality
- Conscious: “Brain Web” later +300 ms indicating amplified & synchronized information across large areas of brain (dependent on coherent activity connected by cortico-cortical connections through white-matter tracts)





## Electrophysiology of consciousness


- Gamma 30 - 100 Hz
- Beta 12.5 - 30
- Alpha 8 - 12.6
- Theta 4 - 7
- Delta 0.5 - 4
- Infra-slow < 0.5

# Who is Conscious?

**Conscious Animals**</br>
**Babies and Development of Consciousness**

---

## The evolution of the brain
- Which animals are conscious?

![](Harley_fig.1_10.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" height="450"}
![](Harley_fig10_2.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" left="100" height="450"}


## Conscious Animals? Monkeys?{.smaller}

> “He who understands baboons would do more for metaphysics than Locke” - Charles Darwin, Notebooks (1838)

- Do animals have consciousness even though they can’t describe it?
    - Short answer, yes.Consciousness is not unique to humans.
    
- The dense network of connections that give rise to consciousness are found in macaque monkeys, and workspace possibly in all mammals.
    - Although monkeys cannot verbally report conscious awareness, 
they can produce non-verbal gesture for if they consciously perceived what occured in the experiment. 
     -  Binocular rivalry, masking, subliminal & threshold 
     - Litmus test of conscious auditory perception (beep beep boop) (only globally) 


## Self-conscious Monkeys? 

- Metacognition:   
   - thoughts about your thoughts, *known-knowns*, *known-unknowns*, *unknown-unknowns* 

-  Macaque monkeys generalized use of opt-out key to memory task 
   - “escape” response on difficult tasks 



## Uniquely Human abilities of Consciousness{.smaller}

- What sets humans apart? 
    -  Sheer Brain size? Language? Social cooperation? 
    
> Only Homo sapiens “use[s] words or other signs by composing them, as we do to declare our thoughts to others.” -Descartes 

- “Language of thought” 
    -  Perhaps language evolved as a representational device rather than communication system 
    -  In all primates, consciousness initially evolved as a communication device 
    -  In humans alone this was amplified by a second evolution 
    -  Ability to formulate sophisticated beliefs and to share them 
    -  Example: “he thinks that I do not know that he lied”


## The development of consciousness
- Are babies conscious?
   - “Not as conscious”
   - Babies and pain

## Conscious Babies?{.smaller}

::: {.column width="60%"}

The Great Mistake: Confusing immaturity with dysfunction

- *Prenatal* 6 mo:  Cortex begins to form & fold
- Babies are largely attracted to language (Language Acquisition Device)

- Dehaene Experiment: 
     - Use fMRI to look inside *2 month old*  </br> infants' heads 
		while listening to maternal language.
     - Language areas lit up in the brain 
        - even Broca’s area 

- Infants language areas work, but... 
   - at much slower pace
- Evidence of working memory: 2 months

## Conscious Babies: Global Conscious Response{.smaller}

- Local-Global Test: repeating series of sounds to test consciousness 
    - Evoked P3 waves: subject has conscious access
- Dehaene and wife ran adapted test to keep toddlers attention
- Results: 2-month old babies were already emitting global conscious
response to novelty
- Babies responses to test still much slower than adults



## Conscious Babies: Visual Masking{.smaller}


- Faces shown at or near threshold of visibility
     - for adults: 50 ms, for babies: 100 ms
     - Difference in time gets made up by 12 months
- Frontal negativity waves in Prefrontal cortex similar to adult P3 wave
     - Babies experiencing a stimulus, but can’t report it aloud

# The Ultimate Test of Theories of Consciousness

![](Harley_fig10_4.jpg){.absolute bottom="-200" right="0" height="400"}

**Can incomplete brains be conscious?** 

- Anencephaly  
- Hydrocephaly  

[A rare neurological disorder seen </br> that may have been sparked by RSV](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/11/29/a-rare-neurological-disorder-seen-that-may-have-been-sparked-by-rsv)

---

## Introduction{.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}
The ultimate test to theories of consciousness: the clinic
  
- Current science of consciousness is coming close to being able to identify which patients retain a conscious life and those who do not. 


- Clinical interventions 
    - Stimulation of brain’s **deep nuclei** can speed up recovery of consciousness
    - **Brain-computer interfaces** (BCI) may restore form of communication to locked-in patients who are conscious though fully paralyzed

## Literary Depiction & Acknowledgment{.smaller}

#### The Count of Monte Cristo

- Alexandre Dumas	- One of the first literary descriptions of locked-in syndrome (Monsieur Noirtier)

#### The Diving Bell And The Butterfly

- Jean-Dominique Bauby 
    - 21 day coma, awoke to find himself fully paralyzed except one eye and part of his head
    - Conceived, memorized, dictated, and published a book (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) on his experiences over the course of 15 months before his death 
    - Dictated the book one character at a time by blinking his left eyelid while and assistant recited the letters
    - Imprisoned in a motionless body which he describes as a diving bell and his fully intact mind as a butterfly 


## Survey by the French Association of Locked-In Syndrome{.smaller}

A *good* theory of consciousness predicts why some lose consciousness & others do not

- Person who first detects consciousness in locked-in patients usually not physician 
- Average duration of 2 ½ months elapses before a correct diagnosis is established, some even as late as 4 years 
    - signs of consciousness can literally mean life or death for crippled patients
    - The field is now moving toward simpler and cheaper methods to detect consciousness
- Voluntary eye movements dismissed as reflexive
    - 40% of those initially classified as unresponsive and “vegetative” turn out to present minimal consciousness


## Coma: How to Lose Your Mind{.smaller}

- A prolonged loss of the capacity to be roused.
- The patient lies unresponsive with eyes closed.
- No amount of stimulation can awaken them and they show no signs of awareness of self or environment.

## How Neurologists Distinguish </br> Coma from Brain Death{.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Brain Death** 

- Total absence of brainstem reflexes.
- Positron Emission tomography (PET) and other measures show that cortical metabolism and perfusion of blood to the brain are annihilated.
- Cortical and thalamic neurons quickly degenerate and melt away, erasing all lifelong memory that define a person 

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Coma**

- EEG of coma patients continue fluctuation at a slow rate, producing low-frequency waves
- Many cortical and thalamic cells are still alive & active but in an inappropriate network state for wakefulness.
:::
:::


## Neurological Disorders{.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Vegetative state** 

- preserved sleep wake cycle with no signs of consciousness. 
- The patient breathes spontaneously when fed artificially does not die.
    - Ex. Terri Schiavio
  
**Minimally conscious state**

- Rare, inconsistent and limited response residual comprehension and volition
- Unlike vegetative patient who smiles or cries at random times, minimally conscious patient may also express emotions that are appropriately linked to the current context


::: 
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Coma Recovery Scale** 

- A series of objective bedside tests - applied in a precisely controlled manner. 
- Using this scale the medical team can distinguish between a vegetative patient and minimally conscious one with much greater accuracy.

**Locked in syndrome**

- Brainstem lesion disconnects cortex from spinal cord output pathways
- Cortex & thalamus spared: consciousness entirely intact
- Individuals suffering from locked-in-syndrome are fully conscious

:::{.notes}
The confused sluggish state of mind that we all experience after being knocked out, anesthetized, or severely inebriated.
Distinguish between a vegetative patient and a minimally conscious one with greater accuracy.

## The thalamus and thalamo-cortical loop{.smaller}

- All point to the role of the thalamus in (un-)consciousness 
- Are NCC frontal or posterior?
- Resonance in the thalamo-cortical loop
- Re-entry and the dynamic core hypothesis




![](Harley_fig10_6.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" left="50" height="350"}

## Integrated information theory (IIT)
- Consciousness is information being linked and integrated
- Tononi
- [Phi (φ) as a measure](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory)

![](MormannKochNeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg){.absolute bottom="-50" right="0" height="500"}


## Radical plasticity
- Cleeremans
- Our neural system has to learn to become conscious
- Prediction of Bodily, Affective, and Cognitive States


## Summary
- There are neural correlates of consciousness
- The thalamo-cortical loop plays an important role in consciousness
