## ch2.7 Consciousness Takes Time

- Millisecond:
   - One one-thousandth (0.001) of a second.
- Masking:
   - An experimental procedure in which target images are flashed very briefly and conscious awareness is blocked by subsequent images.
- Subliminal:
   - Images presented below the threshold of conscious awareness, as in masking experiments.
- Unconscious:
   - Brain activity that lacks conscious awareness but may rise to the level of the preconscious.
- Pre-conscious:
   - Unconscious activity that directly influences conscious behavior.
- Somatosensory cortex:
   - A cortical region reacting to sensory input from the skin, including touch, pain, and temperature stimuli.
- Motor cortex:
   - The region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements.
