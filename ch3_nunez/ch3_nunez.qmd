- Complexity science: study of complex systems composed of many interacting parts.  
- Features of complex systems: exhibit global (large-scale) behavior that cannot be easily explained in terms of their smaller parts.  
- Nested hierarchy: a structure of causality that has multiple levels of command and control (webpage)
- Rules of interaction

- Descriptive labels: 
  - analogues: a system that has many properties in common with some different system, implying a stronger relationship than a metaphor or cartoon 
  - metaphors: a system that has some properties that remind of a different system
  - cartoon: a superficial representation of some properties of something else

<br><br>Membrane current due to local excitatory synaptic action. An action potential propagating along the presynaptic axon activates a neurotransmitter in the synaptic knob that changes local membrane conductivities to select ions, thereby producing a local current sink and more distant distributed sources to preserve current conservation.

- The macrocolumn scale in neocortex is defined by the spatial extent of axon branches E that remain within the cortex (*recurrent/reafferent collaterals*). 

- The large pyramidal cell (C) is one of 10^5 to 10^6 neurons in the macrocolumn. 

- Nearly all pyramidal cells send an axon (G) into the white matter, most re-enter the cortex at some distant location (*corticocortical fibers*).

- Each large pyramidal cell has 10^4 to 10^5 synaptic inputs (F) causing microcurrent sources and sinks s(r', w,t). 

- Field measurements can be expected to fluctuate greatly when small electrode contacts (A) are moved over distances of the order of cell body diameters. 

- Small-scale recordings measure space-averaged potential over some volume (B) depending mostly on the size of the electrode contact. 

- An instantaneous imbalance in sources or sinks in regions D and E will cause a diffuse current density J and potential difference delta phi across the cortex.

- Schematic representation of brain network construction and graph theoretical analysis using fMRI data. After processing (B) the raw fMRI data (A) and division of the brain into different parcels (C), several time courses are extracted from each region (D) so that they can create the correlation matrix (E). To reduce the complexity and enhance the visual understanding, the binary correlation matrix (F), and the corresponding functional brain network (G) are constructed, respectively. Eventually, by quantifying a set of topological measures, graph analysis is performed on the brainâ€™s connectivity network (H).

- Fig. 2 | Measuring and modelling brain network function. 
- 2a) The measurement of brain network function begins with experimental data specifying the activity of neurons or brain regions, such as variations in blood oxygen level in different parts of the brain measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (left panel). 
- The similarities between pairs of activity time series (described by measures such as correlation or synchronization) are encoded in a similarity matrix (centre panel; colours represent similarity values). 
- This matrix, in turn, defines a functional brain network constructed from our original measurements of neural activity (right panel). 
- 2b) Models of artificial neurons (left panel) take in a weighted combination of inputs, which they pass through a nonlinear threshold function to generate an output. Networks of artificial neurons, from deep neural networks to Hopfield networks, can reproduce key aspects of human information processing, such as learning from examples and storing memories. 
- By contrast, biophysical models (right panel) of individual neurons capture realistic functional features such as the propagation of the nerve impulse. When interconnected with artificial synapses, these models can simulate entire neuronal networks. 
- Complementary mesoscale approaches, including neural mass models, average over a population of neurons to derive a mean firing rate. To simulate the large-scale activity of an entire brain, neural mass models representing brain regions are embedded into a network with connectivity derived from measurements of neural tracts, such as those calculated using diffusion tensor imaging (Fig. 1a).

- Small world network topology: a social, physical, brain or other network in which a few long-distance (non-local) connections cause a substantial reduction in the path lengths that between pairs of network nodes
- Graph theory: (network) mathematics of nodes and edges
